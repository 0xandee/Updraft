## HTML Fund Me: Setup

In this lesson, we'll learn how to set up a basic application to demonstrate how MetaMask interacts with a website. 

First, we need to clone the repository from Github. We can do this by opening our terminal and using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyfrinAccel0/html-fund-me-f23
cd html-fund-me-f23
```

Once we've cloned the repository, we can open the `index.html` file in our browser. This will display the basic webpage that we'll be working with. 

We'll be using the Live Server extension to run the website right from VS Code. This extension allows us to quickly preview changes and test our code.

This website is the foundation for our HTML Fund Me application. As we progress, we'll add functionality to allow users to interact with a smart contract through their MetaMask wallets.
