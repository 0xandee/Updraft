## Moccasin Five More

We're going to keep moving right along in this course. We're going to be learning about modules today. The repo's coming along very well. We're going to keep moving on along here, and we're going to go into be the next section, the Moccasin Five More. This is going to be the final time we work with our favorites contract. We will see you no more. However, we're not just working with the favorites contract. We're going to be working with a few other contracts here.  

Let me show you what we're going to be learning in this section. We have a couple of new contracts, along with a `favorites_factory` contract, that we will interact with. We will also use the `ext call` to interact with our contracts and also learn about `static call`.

We also have an interface, which is a new thing we've not encountered before. Our main Vyper code will be in our `five_more.vy` file. We'll use it to import favorites. 

We're going to use the `initialize`  and `favorites.init` functions. 

We also have the `export` function at the bottom of our file. 

This section is all about modules. We will be playing a whole bunch with this contract.  This should be a quick pit stop here, just to learn about modules, and then we're going to go on to the more advanced Buy Me a Coffee.
