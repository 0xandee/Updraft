## Section: Moccasin: Buy Me A Coffee

In this section, we are going to make our Buy Me A Coffee project very professional.

We are going to use the GitHub repo associated with the project to find all the code.

We are going to make some changes to the code, including refactoring, modules and imports. The biggest thing that we are going to improve on is our deployment process and our tests.

We will write unit tests, staging tests and integration tests.

We are going to learn what deployments.db does and what storage does.

We are going to learn about a powerful moccasin feature called manifest named, and how it makes testing easier.

Finally, we are going to push our code up to GitHub, which will be the start of your portfolio.

Now let's look at the tests.

We can run our tests with the following command:

```bash
mox test
```

We can also run coverage tests with:

```bash
mox test --coverage
```

We can also run tests on a fork of the Sepolia testnet with:

```bash
mox test --network sepolia --fork
```

We can also run staging tests.

We are going to learn how to write very defensible code. One mistake can mean the end of millions of dollars.

In the smart contract world, you need to be able to write very defensible code.

We are going to learn about all the cool features of moccasin, and you are going to become a better Python and Vyper developer.

We are going to push this code up to GitHub so you can start building your portfolio.
