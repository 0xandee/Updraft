## Section Headers in Vyper

We've learned about how to format our Vyper code with tools such as `black` and `ruff`. However, when our code grows, it can become difficult to navigate and understand. Section headers help with this.

Section headers help us organize our code and separate it into different sections. For instance, we can separate the **Imports**, **State Variables**, and **Functions** sections to make our code easier to read and understand.

There are two main ways to create section headers:

- Using `vheader` Python package
- Using `headers-vy` Rust package

## `vheader` Python Package

We can use the `vheader` Python package to generate section headers in our Vyper code. Let's look at how to install this package.

First, we go to the repository's `README` file.

Then, we copy the following command to install `vheader`:

```bash
uv tool install vheader
```

Once installed, we can run the following command in our terminal:

```bash
vheader imports
```

This command will generate a section header for the **Imports** section in our Vyper code.

We can do the same for other sections:

```bash
vheader state variables
```

```bash
vheader functions
```

This will add section headers to the **State Variables** and **Functions** sections.

## `headers-vy` Rust Package

There is also the `headers-vy` Rust package that we can install.

To install `headers-vy`, we need to make sure Rust and Cargo are installed on our machine. The `README` file has instructions for installing those if needed.

Once we have Rust and Cargo installed, we can clone the `headers-vy` repository and run the following command in our terminal to install the package:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Once the package is installed, we can run the following command in our terminal:

```bash
./headers-vy "testing 123"
```

This command will generate the following header:

```bash
# ##################################################
#                                                  #
#                            TESTING 123          #
#                                                  #
# ##################################################
```

## Conclusion

Adding section headers to our Vyper code can significantly improve readability and organization. By separating our code into distinct sections, we can make it easier to navigate and understand, ultimately leading to more maintainable and efficient code.
