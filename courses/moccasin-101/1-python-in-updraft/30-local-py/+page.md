## Local Python Development: An Introduction

We are going to create our first Python project and use a more professional environment.

### Project Creation

First, we need to create a new directory. 

We can do this using the command:

```bash
mkdir python-in-updraft-cu
```

Or to keep things in order, we can use:

```bash
mkdir 1-python-in-updraft-cu
```

Then hit enter.

If we run the command `ls`, we can see we now have a folder, `python-in-updraft-cu`, and a file `README.md`.

### Navigating to Our New Directory

Next, we will navigate to the newly created folder. We can do this using the command:

```bash
cd python-in-updraft-cu
```

You can also use the Tab key to auto-complete the directory name. This is a helpful tip. 

We can check our current location by using the command:

```bash
pwd
```

### Opening Our Project in Visual Studio Code

Now we need to open the project in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by typing the command:

```bash
code .
```

Alternatively, you can open Visual Studio Code, go to the "File" menu, click "Open Folder" and then select the `python-in-updraft-cu` folder.
