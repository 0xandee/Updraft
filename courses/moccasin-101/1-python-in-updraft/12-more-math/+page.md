## Advanced Math

In this lesson, we're going to take a look at advanced math operations in Python.

We can do something called integer division.

```python
print("integer division")
my_number = 7 // 2
print(my_number)
```
Integer division will round down our division to the nearest whole number.

We can also do something called modulo. This will return the remainder of our division.

```python
print("modulo")
my_number = 7 % 2
print(my_number)
```
For example, 7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

Finally, we can perform exponent operations.

```python
print("exponents")
my_number = 2 ** 3
print(my_number)
```
The double multiply symbol means raise to the power of. So, 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.
