## Installing VS Code for Linux and macOS Users

We will now be setting up our development environment. This will be one of the hardest parts of the whole course. So, if it takes you a long time, that's okay! If you're able to solve everything quickly, great! Please use the discussions forums, AI, and search engines if you get stuck on any part.

The first thing we're going to want to do is download VS Code. You can download the Mac installation of VS Code, or, if you're working with Linux, download the Linux installation.

Once we have it installed, it will look a little something like this. And if it's a fresh installation, it'll even give you some tips and tools to actually get started. If you've never worked with Visual Studio Code before, we highly recommend going through any "Get Started" or "Getting Instructions" tips that come with opening Visual Studio Code.  Additionally, we have a Visual Studio Code crash course in the GitHub repo associated with this course.
