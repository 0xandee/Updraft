## Google Colab Python Cells

In this lesson, we will walk through a quick crash course in Python using the Google Colab tool. 

Google Colab is an excellent tool for running Python code online in your browser. You don't have to download or install anything to get started. Colab is similar to the way we were able to run everything online in the browser in previous lessons.

Let's start with Google Colab:

We will walk through setting up your development environment on MacOS and Linux, and Windows with WSL. Microsoft recommends installing Python from the Windows store, using PowerShell or using a different method, but we won't be doing that. Instead, we will teach you the Linux-based way, which is how many developers work, maybe even 99% of smart contract developers.

We will first go over Google Colab and complete a Python crash course. Then, we will learn how to install and set up Python on your computers.

We are going to skip all the installation and setup sections of the local development environment. If you are already comfortable with Python, feel free to do so as well. 

Let's start with Google Colab:
-  We will be going over the completed code for the Google Colab.
-  It's located here: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OhOh0TtmJjlMKXwnbD-00ckXP3supNCwf7usps-sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OhOh0TtmJjlMKXwnbD-00ckXP3supNCwf7usps-sharing) 
-  We'll do a brief walkthrough of everything you will see.

**Python Crash Course:**

We will walk through a Python crash course in the Google Colab.

We will be teaching you Python, but we're also teaching you smart contract development.

**Terminal Commands:**
```bash
code .
```

**Python in Updraft**

We will cover how to install and set up Python locally. We will not be covering the Microsoft way of using PowerShell or the Windows store. We will be teaching you the Linux-based way which is how most developers work.

In our opinion, setting up Python locally is the hardest part of this whole course.

**Gitpod or Codespaces**

If you are comfortable with Python and have a good foundation, you may choose to skip the setup sections. 

We will then go over a Python crash course, and then cover how to install and set up Python locally. Again, we will be skipping the Gitpod or Codespaces sections. Don't skip the Python in Updraft sections, because I promise you, the Python in Updraft section will be different from what you are used to.

**Recap:**

We have given you a heads up that these are the steps we will be taking. We will start by walking through a Python crash course with Google Colab. Then, we will learn how to install and set up Python locally.
