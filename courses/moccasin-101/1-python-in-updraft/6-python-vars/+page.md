## Variables in Python

Let's talk about variables. In Python, we can assign different variables. 

Our generative AI is even giving us a suggestion here. 

And variables are essentially keywords that we can use to represent some other value. 

For example, we can say: 
```python
my_variable = 7
```

Now, anytime we use this keyword, my_variable, it's going to represent the number 7. 

So, if we were to print out my_variable, what do you think it will print out? Well, if we hit this little play button here to execute the cell, we see it prints out the number 7 because my_variable now represents 7. 

The keywords or the names of your variables can be almost anything that you want. We can assign almost anything to a variable, and Python comes with many types. 

For example, we can assign numbers:
```python
my_number = 10
```

We can assign something called booleans which are true or false. We can say:
```python
my_boolean = True
```

We can also do false. 

We can assign whole strings or text:
```python
my_string = "hello!"
```
Strings are denoted by being between these little quotes here. We can use single quotes or double quotes, both work great in Python. 

If the word string is a little confusing to you, just know that anytime someone says hey, this is a string, a string just means it's text. It means it's not a number, it's not a boolean, it's just text.
