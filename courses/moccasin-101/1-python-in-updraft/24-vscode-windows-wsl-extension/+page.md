## Windows Users ONLY: WSL VSCode Extension

We will be using a terminal built directly into Visual Studio Code.  This is a Linux or Ubuntu terminal. We want to install the **WSL** extension for **Visual Studio Code** which is available from Microsoft.  

The WSL extension will pop up a terminal window similar to the PowerShell window, but we will choose Ubuntu to create a Linux terminal. This can be accessed by clicking on the three dots in the Visual Studio Code terminal dropdown and choosing **Ubuntu**.  

We will also be using the **Open a Remote Window** section at the bottom left of Visual Studio Code.  We will select **Connect to WSL** in this dropdown to open up our VS Code directly in a WSL Ubuntu setup. 

To open a new terminal, we can either click on the three dots in the terminal dropdown and choosing **New Terminal**, or we can use the shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + `**.  

When we are in the Ubuntu terminal in VS Code, we will use Linux commands. We will not use Windows commands. If a website says, "Here is the Linux command, here is the Windows command", we will use the Linux command if we are in the Ubuntu terminal in VS Code.  

If we close out of Visual Studio Code and reopen it, we will be able to reconnect to the Ubuntu terminal by using the **Open a Remote Window** section at the bottom left of Visual Studio Code and selecting **Connect to WSL**.  

We will be working with Ubuntu or WSL or this Linux-like environment throughout this course.
