## Math in Python

We can perform simple mathematical calculations in Python. Let's look at addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Addition

```python
print("add")
my_number = 5 + 5
print(my_number)
```

### Subtraction

```python
print("subtract")
my_number = 5 - 5
print(my_number)
```

### Multiplication

```python
print("multiply")
my_number = 5 * 5
print(my_number)
```

### Division

```python
print("divide")
my_number = 7 / 2
print(my_number)
```

We can run the script and view the results.
