### Building a Portfolio

Now that we've done all this amazing work, we absolutely need to show it off. The world needs to know what we're capable of.

---

Create a new repository on your GitHub profile. Name it whatever you'd like. I'm going to name mine `updraft-security-portfolio`.

Next, select `upload an existing file`.

Now, rename your report something appropriate. It's important to date your audit reports! I'll name mine `2023-12-19 PasswordStore Audit Report`.

---

Drag and drop your PDF into the available space on GitHub. In VS Code you can `right-click` your PDF and select `Reveal in File Explorer` or `Reveal in Finder` for PC and Mac respectively.

Select `Commit Changes` at the bottom, and that's all there is to it! You can add your own README describing the contests of this repo and your security journey. Great work!
