# Understanding the Complexity of Codebase Audits: An In-Depth Exploration

In the world of coding, auditing your codebase is akin to a treasure hunt. Only in this case, the treasure isn't chests of gold and diamonds, but issues and flaws that need to be addressed. It’s a crucial process for maintaining code quality and ensuring your app's security. At times, the search can appear discouraging, especially when a clear solution or bug isn't immediately evident. This blog post will dive into the complex world of codebase audits and why it may sometimes feel like you're going around in circles, even though you’re on the right track.

Having reached this point, you're likely deep into your codebase, scanning various components and notes, and your eyes may have become glossed over with `SRC` entries. You’ve probably posed the question “Do we have any audit highs?”

There's no sugarcoating it: learning that you haven't unearthed any 'high' flag issues may feel deflating. After all, you’re searching for bugs that pose serious risk and, logically, finding a higher risk issue means you’re making progress, right? Unfortunately, this reasoning skips a very important point: security reviews are not linear.

It's not as simple as starting at Point A and proceeding seamlessly to Point B. Sometimes, you only find small, lower-risk issues. Sometimes, you hit a wall. And occasionally, you find exactly what you've been looking for.

## Perseverance is Key: Addressing Absence of Medium-category Issues

The feeling of dismay might deepen when you move to the next level - the medium-category issues, only to discover a similar scenario – no apparent bugs. These mid-level issues often provide a balance between complexity and harm potential, making them valuable finds during the audit process.

The very absence of any high or medium level issues might make you question - “What's going on?”

And this is where the answer starts to become apparent.

## The Non-linear Nature of Security Audits

Just as with any code review, a ton of questions may spring up, some of which will remain unanswered. Within these mysteries could be hidden the very bugs you seek. You might have already spotted some bugs but dismissed them because they didn't fit into the 'high' or 'medium' categories you were actively searching for.

That’s why it’s so important to remember that path isn't a straight line. It might feel like you're going in circles, but each review, each question asked, and each bug found is a step forward.

Remember, it’s not about high or medium issues; it's about the hunt for irregularities that can compromise your application's security. It’s arduous and often tedious, but that doesn’t mean you’re not making strides. Every time you cycle through your code, peering at it from all angles, you're gaining a broader perspective and understanding of how your codebase functions.

## Conclusion: Keep Going

So, next time you find yourself wrapped up in a painstaking codebase audit, don’t be discouraged if you’re not finding high or medium issues. Remember the nature of security reviews—they are complex, they are multifaceted, and they are definitely not linear.

Keep going, keep searching, and trust that while the path may seem winding and peppered with dead ends, it is leading you to a more robust and secure codebase.
