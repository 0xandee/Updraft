# The Art of Debugging: A Deep Dive into Oracle Manipulation

Hello Code Lovers! We're back with another exciting and intriguing chapter of our journey today. So, keep your curiosity alive as we have some complex but fascinating issues to untangle.

## Unravelling the Mystery: Deleting a Mapping

First things first â€“ let's delve into one compelling question that's been troubling us: Does deleting a mapping work? Remember, the key to successful debugging is not just fixing the bug, but comprehending the reason behind it.

After a thorough examination, we did come across some irregularities earlier. But with our renewed focus, let's try to unlock this puzzle.

## Decoding the Fee Calculation Conundrum

Moving on to another important question: How does the fee get calculated? Now, if you'll recall from our previous discussion, we uncovered some strange issues concerning the fee represented in the token.

Without getting bogged down by the past problems, let's scrutinize if there's a deeper complication here, especially with the usage of T-SWAP as the protocol.

On a side note, this is an instance where the wisdom derived from previous experience comes into play. It's essentially when debugging starts resembling a thrilling treasure hunt - the more treasures (read: issues) you uncover, the more experienced and capable you become.

So, roll up your sleeves as we uncover a grave inconsistency embedded in the depths of this code.

## The Hidden Dragon: Oracle Manipulation Issues with AMM

As we delve deeper, there's a staggering hiccup with using the reserves of a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or an Automated Market Maker (AMM), like TSwap. Did you know the reserves' modification could drastically alter the price, thus jeopardizing the entire protocol?

Consider, for instance,If you could alter the reserves in TSwap, it, in turn, alters the price and disrupts the entire protocol.

This brings us to our next cornerstone - understanding Oracle Manipulation, to determine any potential malfunctions leading to a breach.

## Oracle Manipulation: Spotting the #1 Attack Vector of 2023

There's a critical question to address here: What's the likelihood of a breakdown? And if it exists, can it expose the system to potential hacks?

If you're in tune with the trends, then you most certainly know that Price Oracle Manipulation topped the list of attack vectors for the first half of 2023. It's essential to have a clear understanding of how it operates, how to steer clear of it and, most importantly, spotting this concern.

Unfortunately, the problem is commonplace in competitive audits, private audits, and also manifests "in the wild."

Let's delve into this vast sea of knowledge, which may seem intimidating for beginners but indeed holds the key to amending this widespread issue.
