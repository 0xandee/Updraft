# Flash Loans: Making Blockchain Arbitrage Accessible

Arbitrage, the simultaneous buying and selling of assets in different markets to take advantage of differing prices, has long been an effective strategy for the 'financially fearless' among us. A concept traditionally dominated by the deep-pocketed whales of Wall Street, the decentralised finance (DeFi) world is flipping the field on its head with the application of flash loans.

Can't tell your flash loans from your DeFi? No worries, mate. Let's dive deep into it all and level the arbitrage playing field!

### The Magic of Flash Loans

But what's a flash loan? A flash loan is a loan that lasts exactly one transaction! Quite an alien concept to anyone versed in traditional finance, this tool is peculiar and unique to the DeFi blockchain realm.

Why so peculiar, you ask? That's because a flash loan smart contract can stipulate 'if you don't pay me back, I will just revert everything that you've done'. Imagine the applications!

### Where the Whales Swim: An Example

This is where it gets interesting. Major players (whales) deposit large sums of money into protocols that host flash loans. Why? Because every flash loan carries a fee, incentivising whales to keep their money safely in the protocol. But how does this tie into arbitrage, and why should we care?

Well, let's scope out a practical application of flash loans in our arbitrage world.

Imagine two different cryptocurrency exchanges present a price discrepancy for the same asset. If you had the funds, you could buy from one exchange at a lower price and sell on the other at a higher price, making a neat profit. This requires substantial initial investment to explore, which is where flash loans change the game completely.

Flash loans democratize the arbitrage domain, allowing even the smallest fish in the sea to swim amongst the whales. By providing the funds for the duration of one transaction, users can perform arbitrages without owning the requisite amount at the outset!

### Flash Loans and DeFi: A New Era of Financial Democracy

In a regular finance landscape, opportunities for arbitrage are available exclusively to the wealthy class. The DeFi landscape transforms the traditional constructs of finance by opening these virtual doors to anyone and everyone. Flash loans are an empowering tool for the smaller fish to leapfrog the barriers of entry and start swimming in the arbitrage ocean.

### Life in the Flash Lane: From Arbitrage to Collapse

Another fascinating interaction that can occur between flash loans and DeFi protocols involves ‘price manipulation’. Here, users leverage flash loans to manipulate the price on a decentralized exchange (DEX), resulting in opportunities for further trading advantages.

This tactic is illustrated in a test we conducted using an imaginary 'Thunder Loans' protocol. We set it up, requested a flash loan, and manipulated the reserve ratios of the DEX, causing a significant change in price. This setup enabled us to borrow another flash loan, this time with a substantially lower fee due to the manipulated rates.

This might sound somewhat unscrupulous, as the liquidity providers (the whales) lose out, yet the strategy worked. We completed all the necessary moves, hit the 'Thunderloan flash loan' button, manipulated the contract code, ensured the change in reserves, and witnessed the price drop from a 1:1 ratio down to a 1:2 ratio.

Finally, we executed another flash loan, leaving us with a drastically cheaper fee due to our manipulations with the initial flash loan. We then repaid this loan, leading us into an intriguing question: What if we didn't need to repay?

This was quite a jog around the DeFi neighborhood and our thrilling exploration of flash loans. Now, take a breather, grab some water or coffee, and let’s gear up for the next leg of this captivating journey in the fantastic world of blockchain technology!

Remember, with DeFi and flash loans, the future of finance is truly in your hands.
