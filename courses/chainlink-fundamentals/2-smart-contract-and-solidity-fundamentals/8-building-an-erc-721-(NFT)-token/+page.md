# Using Open Zeppelin Contracts Wizard

The [Open Zeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) is an interactive smart contract generator based on OpenZeppelin Contracts.

In this exercise, we will create a simple [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFT contract. 

When you first open the wizard, you will see an interface with options for the type of contract you want to create, including ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, Governor, and Custom.

We will be selecting the **ERC-721** option as this is the token standard for NFTs.

On the left side, you’ll notice the **Settings** tab. This is where we can configure various features for our NFT. We will be setting the following:

- Name
- Symbol
- Mintable
- Auto-increment Ids

You will notice that the code is automatically filled out for you as you click various options. This makes it very quick and easy to generate templates for these contracts.

In the upcoming Chainlink VRF Section, you will learn how to take this knowledge and utilize Chainlink VRF to add randomness to an NFT, creating a lot more fun for your users!

## Conclusion

[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) is a powerful and evolving language for building decentralized applications. By mastering its fundamentals—from state variables to modifiers, visibility specifiers, and smart contract libraries, students can confidently develop efficient, secure smart contracts. 

This course aims to provide the foundational knowledge necessary to build real-world applications with Solidity and Chainlink.

In our next Section, **Oracles and Chainlink Data Feeds**, you will learn about the Chainlink Data Feeds service and how blockchain Oracles create a reliable interface between off-chain and on-chain data. This enables smart contracts to interact with the real world while maintaining the blockchain’s core principles of decentralization, trust minimization, and security.
