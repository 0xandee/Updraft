# Using Chainlink Local

In this lesson, instead of using CCIP on a live testnet, we will use Chainlink Local to test sending a cross-chain message with CCIP. 

We will test CCIP using Chainlink Local in Remix. We will send a simple string message cross-chain, e.g., `"Hey There!"`

Let's get started!

## The MessageSender and MessageReceiver contracts

In this lesson, we will write and test, using Chainlink local, two contracts:

1. `MessageSender`: This contract would be deployed to the source chain. It will contain the logic to send the CCIP message, similar to the contract we wrote in Section 5.
2. `MessageReceiver`: This contract will receive the cross-chain message. It will inherit the `CCIPReceiver` abstract contract needed to receive CCIP messages. This means it must implement the required `_ccipReceive` function to process the cross-chain message.

Note: The imports in these contracts require you to use a compiler version of `0.8.20` or higher.

## The MessageSender contract

In Remix, inside the "CCIP" workspace you created in Section 5, create a new folder called `chainlink-local` and inside the folder, create a new file called `MessageSender.sol`. Copy and paste the code from the [course code repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/chainlink-fundamentals-cu/blob/main/chainlink-course-code/ccip/chainlink-local/MessageSender.sol) into the `MessageSender.sol` file.

As always, feel free to skip the code explainer and jump straight to deploying if you aren't interested in learning how to implement CCIP. 

### Code explainer 

The logic of this contract is very similar to that of Section 5, so we will keep things high level. The main things to note are:
- The LINK token and Router are set **dynamically** in the constructor rather than hard-coded. This is because we need to pass these through from Chainlink Local, which we will do shortly.
- `sendMessage` sends the CCIP message.  This contains the same logic as before, except no tokens are added to the tokens array, and a string, `"Hey there!"` is abi encoded and passed to the `data` part of the `Any2EVMMessage` struct:

```solidity
Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory evm2AnyMessage = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
    receiver: abi.encode(receiver),
    data: abi.encode("Hey there!"), // ABI-encoded string
    tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0), // Empty array indicating no tokens are being sent
    extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(
        Client.EVMExtraArgsV2({
            gasLimit: 200_000, // Gas limit for the callback on the destination chain
            allowOutOfOrderExecution: true // Allows the message to be executed out of order relative to other messages from the same sender
        })
    ),
    // Set the feeToken  address, indicating LINK will be used for fees
    feeToken: address(s_linkToken)
});
```

You'll also notice that we now have a non-zero `gasLimit`. This is because this `gasLimit` is used to execute `_ccipReceive`, which will be implemented on the `MessageReceiver` contract. 

## The Message Receiver contract

In Remix still, still inside the "CCIP" workspace you created in Section 5, create a new file called `MessageReceiver.sol` inside the `chainlink-local` folder from before, copy and paste the code from the [course code repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/chainlink-fundamentals-cu/blob/main/chainlink-course-code/ccip/chainlink-local/MessageReceiver.sol) into the `MessageReceiver.sol` file.

### Code explainer

#### Imports

```solidity
import {Client} from "@chainlink/contracts-ccip@1.5.0/src/v0.8/ccip/libraries/Client.sol";
import {CCIPReceiver} from "@chainlink/contracts-ccip@1.5.0/src/v0.8/ccip/applications/CCIPReceiver.sol";
```

- `Client`: Library providing the struct for CCIP messages.
- `CCIPReceiver`: Abstract contract that handles CCIP message receiving logic. The contract inherits this contract.

#### State variables

```solidity
bytes32 private s_lastReceivedMessageId;
string private s_lastReceivedText;
```

- `s_lastReceivedMessageId`: stores the ID of the last received message.
- `s_lastReceivedText`: stores the content (text) of the last received message.

#### Constructor

```solidity
constructor(address router) CCIPReceiver(router) {}
```

- Takes a router address as a parameter.
- Passes this address to the parent `CCIPReceiver` contract constructor.
- Remember from the previous section that the Router is the Chainlink CCIP contract that routes messages between chains.

#### Message receiving logic

```solidity
function _ccipReceive(
    Client.Any2EVMMessage memory any2EvmMessage
) internal override {
    s_lastReceivedMessageId = any2EvmMessage.messageId;
    s_lastReceivedText = abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (string));

    emit MessageReceived(
        any2EvmMessage.messageId,
        any2EvmMessage.sourceChainSelector,
        abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.sender, (address)),
        abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (string))
    );
}
```

- This funciton is defined on `CCIPReceiver` but not implemented. 
- Called automatically when a CCIP message is received.
- Updates state variables with the message details. 
- Decodes the message data into a string using `abi.decode`.
- Emits a `MessageReceived` event with the message details.

#### Message getter function

```solidity
function getLastReceivedMessageDetails()
    external
    view
    returns (bytes32 messageId, string memory text)
{
    return (s_lastReceivedMessageId, s_lastReceivedText);
}
```

- Public function to retrieve the last received message details.
- Returns both the message ID and its text content.

## Create the CCIP Local Simulator contract

To use Chainlink Local in Remix, we need to use the `CCIPLocalSimulator` helper contract.

Create a file called `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` in the `contracts` folder and paste the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

// solhint-disable no-unused-import
import {CCIPLocalSimulator} from "@chainlink/local/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol";
```

Here, we have just imported the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract so we can deploy it locally and use it in our testing. 

## Deploy the contracts

Let's now test sending a cross-chain message from the `MessageSender` contract to the `MessageReceiver` contract using Chainlink Local. 

### Deploy the CCIPLocalSimulator

Let's deploy the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract. Behind the scenes, this contract will deploy some mock contracts for us so that we can simulate the cross-chain message transfer. These contracts from the on-chain CCIP intra.

So far, in this course, we have exclusively deployed to a live testnet by connecting MetaMask using the **Injected providerâ€”MetaMask** **Environment** option.

This time, we want to deploy to Remix's local node - **Rexmix VM (Cancun)**. 

1. In the **Deploy & run transactions** tab click the **Environments** dropdown and select **Remix VM (Cancun)**.

2. Make sure you have the `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` file open in the main window. In the **Contract** dropdown, select `CCIPLocalSimulator`. Click **Deploy**.

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/remix-vm.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='remix-vm'}

3. The `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract will now be visible in the **Deployed Contracts** section. 

4. In the list of functions, click the `configuration` function to retrieve the configuration details for the pre-deployed contracts and services needed for local CCIP simulations. This data forms that on-chain infra we talked about earlier and you will be using the values returned by this function throughout this lesson (these are the values and addresses we would have looked up these values in the [Chainlink directory](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/testnet) if we were working on a live blockchain).

5. Copy the **linkToken_** address.

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/config.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='config'}

### Deploy the LINK token

We need to, as before, fund our `Sender` contract with LINK tokens to pay for CCIP. The LINK token contract is pre-deployed in the local simulator configuration, so you can simply load the LINK token contract instance:
    - Back up in the **Contracts** dropdown, select the `LinkToken` contract.
    - Paste the  **linkToken_** address in the **At Address** box.
    - Click the **At Address** button.

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/at-address.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='at-address'}

Now, the `LinkToken` contract will show in the **Deployed Contracts** section. We will be able to fund contracts with LINK.

### Deploy the MessageSender and MessageReceiver

Now, we need to deploy the `MessageSender` and `MessageReceiver` contracts on the Remix VM (rather than on a live testnet):
1. Click on and compile the `MessageSender` contract. Use the following constructor parameters:
    - `_router`: copy and paste the `sourceRouter_` from the `configuration` call on the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract.
    - `_LINK`: copy and paste the LINK token contract address you just deployed.
    - Click **transact** to deploy the contract.
- Click on and compile the `MessageReceiver` contract. Use the following constructor parameter:
    - `router`: copy and paste the `destinationRouter_` from the `configuration` call on the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract.
    - Click **transact** to deploy the contract.

## Send a cross-chain message using Chainlink Local

Expand the `MessageSender` contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section and expand the `sendMessage` function. Use the following parameters:
- `destinationChainSelector`: copy-paste the `chainSelector_` from the `configuration` call on the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract.
- `receiver`: copy the address of the `MessageReceiver` contract you just deployed.
- `text`: some string message e.g. `"Hey there!"`

**Note**: Remix will fail to estimate the gas properly for the `sendMessage` function. 

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/gas-failed.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='gas-failed'}

To work around this, we need to set the gas limit manually to `3000000` by clicking the radio button at the top of the **Deploy and run transactions** tab:

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/custom-gas-limit.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='custom-gas-limit'}

Click **transact** to call the function and test sending the CCIP message.

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/send-message.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='send-message'}

You'll notice this is near instant! No need to wait for finality - cool right!

To check if the message was received by `MessageReceiver`, call the `getLastReceivedMessageDetails` function. You'll see the message ID and the message we sent using Chainlink Local!

::image{src='/chainlink-fundamentals/6-chainlink-ccip-messages/assets/message-received.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;' alt='message-received'}

And that's it! You have successfully used Chainlink Local in Remix to test sending a cross-chain message with CCIP.
