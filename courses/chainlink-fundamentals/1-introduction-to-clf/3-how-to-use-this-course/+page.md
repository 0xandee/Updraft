# How to use this course

Welcome to the Chainlink Fundamentals course! This guide will help you maximize your learning experience.
Note that unlike other Cyfrin Updraft courses, this course consists entirely of written lessons (no videos so lucky you, you won't need to hear my voice or see my silly face)

## Helpful resources

There are a couple of links I need you to be aware of. 

### GitHub Repository

You'll find a link to the [GitHub Resources](https://github.com/Cyfrin/chainlink-fundamentals-cu) page in the top right of your screen. This repository contains all the code, materials, and information you'll need throughout this course. Consider it your essential reference guide for your Chainlink Fundamentals journey. The repository includes links to code for each course section.

### Discussions forum

The GitHub repository includes a [Discussions tab](https://github.com/Cyfrin/chainlink-fundamentals-cu/discussions) where you can:

- Ask questions
- Discuss topics with fellow students
- Interact with course mentors
- Get help with any challenges you encounter

If you discover any discrepancies or technical issues, please create a discussion post in the GitHub repository so we can address it.

### Discord community

There's also a Discord link for real-time communication with the community. While Discord is excellent for immediate help, we encourage you to post questions in the GitHub discussions as well since they're indexed and searchableâ€”making them valuable resources for future students.

### Learning advice

Take breaks. I cannot tell you how many people have tried to rush through these courses and say, "Oh, I'm going to finish in a single weekend!" Your brain doesn't work like that. Your brain needs time to absorb the information, so take breaks. Every 25 minutes to a half hour, take a 5-minute break, or if you like working in longer chunks, take a whole hour, and then take a 15-20 minute break. Don't rush through the whole course in a day; you won't retain the information. Go outside, go for a walk, grab some ice cream, get some coffee, and go to the gym. Your brain needs time to have the information settle. Maybe every 2 hours, step away. Maybe be done for the day. Work at whatever pace makes sense for you. Everyone's going to have a different learning pace. There is no right speed for this course. People have taken courses in 2 weeks, in 3 months, in 6 months. It doesn't matter. Pick a pace that you can do, and stick to it.

If you don't want to do developer stuff, skip the code breakdowns and Solidity explainers. If you want to go right to the advanced stuff, do that. Like I said, go the pace and take the learnings you want.

After every lesson, it might be a good idea to reflect on it to ensure that the knowledge is ingrained. Repetition is the mother of skill, and we will repeat a lot of smart contract development.

### Additional Learning Tools

Be sure to use tools like, of course, the GitHub Discussions tab, [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/), the decentralized Q&A forum Peeranha.io, issues on different GitHubs, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Questions, queries, or problems?

Post your questions on the [GitHub discussion tab](https://github.com/Cyfrin/chainlink-fundamentals-cu/discussions) on the repo associated with this course. A Cyfrin team member will be able to triage or answer your question, and their students will be able to see the answer if they have a similar question. 

Also, feel free to contact the [Cyfrin Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cyfrin) team.
