# Course Introduction

Welcome to the **ULTIMATE** Chainlink Fundamentals course! 

## What is the Chainlink Fundamentals course?

This comprehensive course covers all major Chainlink services:

- Chainlink Data and Price Feeds
- Chainlink Automation
- Chainlink CCIP
- Chainlink Functions
- Chainlink VRF
- Chainlink Data Feeds
- Chainlink Proof of Reserve

Each service has a dedicated section structured as follows:

- A high-level overview explaining the service and its functionality
- A practical Solidity project providing hands-on experience
- A detailed code breakdown for developers showing how to integrate the service

**Note for Non-Developers**: This course is designed for everyone! If you're not a developer, you don't need to master all the technical details. Each section introduces a Chainlink service with:

1. A non-technical, high-level explanation of what it is and how it works
2. A hands-on project demonstrating the service
3. Optional code breakdowns that you can either study in detail or copy-paste to proceed

The projects reinforce your understanding of each service rather than training you as a Chainlink developer. However, aspiring developers should carefully review the complete code breakdowns.

## Prerequisites

### Required

Before taking this course, you must have completed [**Blockchain Basics**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics) to understand:

- What a blockchain is
- The distinction between L1s and L2s
- What blockchain oracles are from a high-level
- MetaMask wallet creation and management
- Using cryptocurrency faucets
- Navigating block explorers (like Etherscan)
- Adding new networks to MetaMask
- Understanding blockchain gas mechanics

### Recommended

We recommend completing the [**Solidity Smart Contract Developer**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/solidity) course before this one. While not mandatory (Section 2 covers Solidity fundamentals), that course provides a more comprehensive foundation. This course offers a condensed overview of Solidity.

## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for:

- Non-technical web3 professionals (sales, business development)
- Solutions architects
- Developers (both beginner and experienced)

We only assume knowledge from the Blockchain Basics course. All code examples can be copied and pasted, and Solidity concepts are explained step-by-step. You don't need any prior programming experience, and the course adapts to your learning needs and preferences.
