## Meet Your Instructor: Ciara Nightingale

Hello and welcome! I’m Ciara Nightingale, and I'm a lead instructor here at Cyfrin Updraft. I'm excited to guide you through this material.

You might be wondering where you can find me online or learn more about my work. I'm active on a few platforms. You can find my YouTube channel at **@ciaranightingale**, where I post various tutorials and sometimes share sneak peeks of new content. On Twitter/X, my handle is **@ciaranightingal**. Please note that it's spelled without the final 'e' – "Nightingal" – simply because the full name didn't fit within the character limit! For most other platforms, my handle is typically **CiaraNightingale**, with no spaces or dots.

I've been actively involved in creating educational content for Cyfrin Updraft, with over 10 hours of material already available on the platform. My contributions span various topics, particularly in the realm of cryptography. For instance, I’ve developed lessons on concepts like Merkle trees, which are part of our **Advanced Foundry course**. I've also contributed significantly to the **Blockchain Basics course**, helping learners build a solid understanding of fundamental blockchain principles.

To give you a little more insight into my background, I'm a Physics graduate from the University of Bath. This academic foundation is particularly valuable when discussing complex subjects within cryptography, such as zero-knowledge proofs. My physics background provides the credentials and understanding necessary to explain these intricate topics clearly and effectively.

Beyond my professional work and as a bit of a fun fact, I enjoy running, going to the gym, and painting in my free time. I look forward to sharing my knowledge with you and helping you on your Web3 learning journey.
