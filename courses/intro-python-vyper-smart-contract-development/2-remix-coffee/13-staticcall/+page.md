## Calling External Contracts in Vyper

We are going to make sure that we use the proper keyword when we call external contracts. In Solidity, it�s pretty straightforward. We just call an external contract. However, iVyperer, we need to use a specific keyword. If we are calling a view function or don�t want to change any state, we use `staticcall`. Otherwise, we use `extcall`, which stands for external call.

We will use the following code block to demonstrate how to call an external contract using `staticcall` in Vyper.

```python
price_feed: AggregatorV3Interface = AggregatorV3Interface(0x6944AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306)
return staticcall price_feed.latestAnswer()
```

So, in this code block, we're first defining a variable called `price_feed` and setting it to an object of type `AggregatorV3Interface`. Next, we are saying that we want to return the value returned by the `latestAnswer` function, which is a view function in this case. We use `staticcall` since we are calling a view function. This means that we are not going to change any state in our contract.
