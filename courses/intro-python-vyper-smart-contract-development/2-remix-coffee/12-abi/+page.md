## ABI

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is an important part of interacting with smart contracts. It defines the functions that a contract exposes and how different applications can interact with them.

We'll look at a simple Vyper contract in Remix and explore the ABI generated by the compiler.

### Generating the ABI

Let's start by compiling our contract.

```bash
Compile buy_me_a_coffee.vy
```

Once compiled, we can see the compilation details, including the ABI. The ABI is a JSON-formatted document that specifies the contract's functions, inputs, outputs, and other metadata.

### Understanding the ABI

The ABI is a list of different types of functions that the smart contract can accept. For example, we can see a `fund` function and a `withdraw` function in our contract.

```python
"root": {
    "0": {
        "type": "string \"function\"",
        "name": "string \"fund\"",
        "stateMutability": "string \"payable\"",
        "inputs": [],
        "outputs": []
    }
},
"1": {
    "type": "string \"function\"",
    "name": "string \"withdraw\"",
    "stateMutability": "string \"nonpayable\"",
    "inputs": [],
    "outputs": []
}
```

The ABI also includes information about the contract's version, EVM version, and other metadata.

### Using the ABI

The ABI is used by applications to interact with the smart contract. By providing the ABI to a library or tool, the application can understand the contract's functions and interact with them accordingly.

The ABI doesn't include the contract's logic. It only defines the interface for interacting with the contract.

We will see how to integrate the ABI into our smart contract in the next lesson.
