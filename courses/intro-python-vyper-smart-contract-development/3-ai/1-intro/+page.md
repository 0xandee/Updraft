## AI Prompting

Why learn this when there is AI?

Now, a lot of people get discouraged by AI thinking, ah, like why bother learning anything if AI already knows a lot of the stuff. Well, in order to think critically about problems and how to solve them, you always need the prerequisite knowledge before you can even start coming up with solutions to fix a problem. So yes, AI knows a lot of things. But, in order for you to solve problems effectively, you need that knowledge as well. So, you need to take the knowledge from AI. Thank you AI for giving us all this knowledge as well. So that you can think critically and come up with better solutions than AI could ever do. Because as of today, that's where humans shine. We are phenomenally better at coming up with solutions. And AI is a tool to help us have even better solutions. But in order for us to come up with the best solutions, we need the knowledge first.
