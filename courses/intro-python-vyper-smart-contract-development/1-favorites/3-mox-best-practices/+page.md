## Welcome to Vyper Fundamentals: Best Practices

Let's start by talking about best practices. We will be looking at some best practices that we cover in our Moccasin course.

If you are viewing this lesson on Cyfrin Updraft, you can head to the **Course Resources** section and you will be taken to the **Cyfrin/mocassin-full-course-cu** GitHub repository. This repository has all the codebase associated with the course. For instance, if we click on **Section 1** of **Vyper 101**, which is titled **Welcome to Remix - Favorite's List**, you will be taken to a repository called **Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu**. This repository has the code associated with that section in the **Favorites.vy** file.

If you are watching this on YouTube, the links are provided in the description.

We can also head back to the **Cyfrin/mocassin-full-course-cu** repository. In here, we can go to the **Discussions** tab. This is a good place to come if you have any questions. We will teach you how to ask questions in a manner that is helpful to both humans and AI.

We will be using AI throughout the course. As of recording, our favorites include **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **ChatGPT**.

We recommend that you pause the video and create a GitHub account. GitHub is crucial to your success as a smart contract developer, or even just as a technical person in Web3.

We also recommend that you check out the **Twitter** and **LinkedIn** links that are provided in the repository.

One other important tool is **Stack Exchange Ethereum**. This is a good place to go to ask questions about Ethereum in general. 

We will now move on to **Section 1** of **Moccasin Fundamentals**: **Welcome to Python!** 

## Welcome to Python!

We're going to do a code block here. We're going to make a little Python script. I'm going to start with a **__main__** function, which is a special function in Python that allows code to be run in a top level.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello world")
```

So, we can copy this code block, and paste it into our terminal. This will print out **Hello world**.

```bash
python code.py
```

And there you have it. Now, we're going to go to the next lesson.
