## Course Best Practices: Navigation, Resources, and Asking Questions

Welcome! To ensure you have the smoothest learning experience possible with the Vyper & Moccasin course, this lesson outlines the best practices for accessing materials, asking questions, and utilizing essential tools. Following these guidelines will help you stay organized and get the support you need effectively.

### Accessing Course Materials and Code

All course resources are centralized for easy access, primarily through GitHub.

1.  **Finding the Main Repository:**
    *   **On Cyfrin Updraft (`updraft.cyfrin.io`):** Locate the GitHub icon dropdown menu in the top right corner and select "Course Resources".
    *   **On YouTube:** Check the video description for the relevant links.
    *   **Direct Link:** The primary hub for this course is the `Cyfrin/moccasin-full-course-cu` repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Cyfrin/moccasin-full-course-cu`

2.  **Navigating the Main Repository (`moccasin-full-course-cu`):**
    *   The `README.md` file in this main repository is your central guide.
    *   It contains a **Table of Contents** linking to different course sections. Use this table to navigate to the specific lesson or topic you're interested in.

3.  **Finding Section-Specific Code:**
    *   The main repository (`moccasin-full-course-cu`) provides the structure and links, but **it does not contain the final code for each lesson directly.**
    *   Within the main `README.md`, each section listed in the Table of Contents (e.g., "Vyper 101" -> "Section 1: Welcome to Remix - Favorite's List") will have a dedicated "Code:" link.
    *   **Important:** This "Code:" link points to a *separate, specific GitHub repository* that holds the completed code for *that particular section*.
    *   **Example:** For the "Section 1: Welcome to Remix - Favorite's List", the "Code:" link directs you to the `Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu` repository (`https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu`). Inside *this* repository, you'll find the final code developed during that section, such as the `Favorites.vy` file (`https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu/blob/main/Favorites.vy`). Use these section-specific repositories to view the final reference code for each part of the course.

### Getting Help and Asking Questions Effectively

Community interaction and asking questions are encouraged, but please use the correct channels.

1.  **Where to Ask Questions:**
    *   All questions, discussions, requests for clarification, or suggestions should be posted in the **Discussions tab** of the *main* course repository: `https://github.com/Cyfrin/moccasin-full-course-cu/discussions`
    *   This is the central place for community interaction and support related to the course content.

2.  **Where NOT to Ask Questions:**
    *   **Do NOT** create "Issues" or "Pull Requests" on the *section-specific code repositories* (like `remix-favorites-cu`) to ask questions. These repositories are intended solely to host the final reference code for each lesson. Use the main repository's Discussions tab instead.

3.  **How to Ask Questions:**
    *   We encourage asking clear, well-structured questions for the most effective help from both the community and AI tools.
    *   Refer to the dedicated guide `how-to-ask-a-question.md` located in the main course repository: `https://github.com/Cyfrin/moccasin-full-course-cu/blob/main/how-to-ask-a-question.md`
    *   This guide provides tips for formulating effective questions, whether you're interacting with instructors, fellow students, or AI assistants.

### Essential Tools for Success

To maximize your learning and align with industry practices, we highly recommend using the following tools:

1.  **GitHub Account:**
    *   If you don't already have one, creating a GitHub account is **highly recommended**.
    *   Proficiency with Git and GitHub is **crucial** for anyone working in a technical role in Web3, including smart contract development.

2.  **AI Assistants ("AI Frens"):**
    *   This course incorporates the use of AI tools to aid learning and development.
    *   Recommended tools (which you can find listed under "Resources For This Course" -> "AI Frens" in the main repo's README) include:
        *   `claude.ai`
        *   `cursor IDE`
        *   `ChatGPT` (used frequently in course examples)
    *   Familiarizing yourself with these tools can significantly enhance your development workflow.

By following these best practices for accessing resources, asking questions, and utilizing key tools, you'll set yourself up for a more productive and engaging learning journey through the Vyper & Moccasin course. Remember to use the main repository's Discussions tab for all your questions!
