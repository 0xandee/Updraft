## Sharing your progress

We're going to talk about the tweet me button on the Moccasin Vyper full course repo.

Go to the repo on GitHub and scroll down to Vyper 101.

We'll be talking about the section titled "Welcome to Remix - Favorite's List".

Click the tweet me button. If you're signed in, this will open a tweet intent. You should see the following text:

```
I just deployed a Smart Contract!
Thanks @PatrickAlphaC, @zkSyncdevs, and @CyfrinUpdraft!
```

Go ahead and send that tweet. Be sure to say hi, we're so excited you're deploying your first smart contract!

You can even thank Tenderly for helping make getting Testnet ETH a lot easier.

We love hearing from all of you, so make sure you tweet out when you deploy your first contract.
