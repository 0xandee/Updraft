## Deploy Your First Vyper Smart Contract

Welcome to the first hands-on coding section of this course! Get ready, because by the end of this lesson, you will achieve a major milestone: writing and deploying your very first smart contract using the Vyper programming language. We're excited for you to take this significant step into the world of blockchain development.

In this section, we'll be working with a specific smart contract named `Favorites.vy`. You can think of it as a simple digital ledger for storing a favorite number and a list of people along with their favorite numbers. We'll build this contract step-by-step. You can see the final version of this code, including comments, state variables (`my_favorite_number`), structs (`Person`), lists (`list_of_people`), mappings (`name_to_favorite_number`), and functions (`store`, `retrieve`, `add_person`), in the course's GitHub repository (`github.com/Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu`).

Our primary tool for this will be the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE), accessible online at `remix.ethereum.org`. Remix provides a convenient platform to write, compile, and deploy our Vyper code directly in your browser. The GitHub repository mentioned above also contains helpful resources, including a direct link in the `README.md` file to open this project in Remix.

To get the most out of this section, active participation is key. We *strongly* encourage you to code along with the instructions. Don't just read â€“ type the code yourself. This hands-on approach is vital for ingraining the concepts and truly understanding how these systems work. Writing the code manually builds muscle memory and deeper comprehension, which is essential for building more complex applications later and even for effectively guiding or correcting AI-generated code in the future.

Remember the adage: "Repetition is the mother of skill." Feel free to pause, reread sections, and experiment on your own as you follow along. Our goal isn't just for you to see the code, but for you to finish this section *with skill*.

Let's get started! By following along, you'll soon have written your first piece of Vyper code and successfully deployed your first smart contract onto a blockchain environment using Remix.
