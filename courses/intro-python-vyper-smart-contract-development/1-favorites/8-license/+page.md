## License

We are building a simple smart contract for a favorites list.

The first line of code we will write in our Vyper smart contract file should be:

```python
# pragma version >=0.4.1
```

This line tells the compiler what version of Vyper we will be using. In this case, we will be using Vyper version 0.4.1.

Next, we will add another line that defines the license of our code:

```python
# @license MIT
```

This line tells the world that this code is licensed under the MIT license.

Let's break down why we use a license:

- There are many types of code licenses out there.
- Most of the code in the blockchain world is open source.
- This line tells the compiler what license our code is under.

The MIT license is one of the most permissive licenses. This means that anyone can use, redistribute, or modify our code as they see fit.

We've now established a basic code structure and license.
