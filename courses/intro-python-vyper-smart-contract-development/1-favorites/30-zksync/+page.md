## Attempting ZKVyper Deployment via Remix

This lesson explores the process of interacting with zkSync using Vyper smart contracts directly within the Remix IDE. While Remix is a powerful tool for smart contract development, we will encounter a specific limitation when using the official ZKSYNC plugin with Vyper.

Let's begin within the Remix IDE environment (`remix.ethereum.org`), where we have a sample Vyper contract, such as `favorites.vy`, open in the editor. Our goal is to compile and deploy this contract to the zkSync network.

To facilitate interaction with zkSync, Remix offers plugins. Follow these steps to activate the ZKSYNC plugin:

1.  Navigate to the **Plugin manager** icon located on the left sidebar.
2.  In the search bar within the Plugin Manager, type "zksync".
3.  Locate the module named "ZKSYNC" with the description "Compile and deploy smart contracts for zkSync Era."
4.  Click the "Activate" button.

Upon activation, a new "ZKSYNC" icon will appear on the left sidebar, and its corresponding panel will open. This panel provides options for compiling and deploying contracts specifically for the zkSync Era environment. You might see a confirmation message indicating the plugin version (e.g., "You are using the latest version of the zkSync plugin: v0.6.3-3").

However, a critical point to note is the current capability of this specific plugin. **As of the time of this writing, the Remix ZKSYNC plugin exclusively supports Solidity contracts.** It does not possess the functionality to compile or prepare Vyper contracts for deployment to zkSync.

Therefore, attempting to use this plugin to compile and deploy our `favorites.vy` contract (or any other Vyper contract) will not succeed. The necessary ZKVyper compilation steps are not integrated into this particular Remix plugin workflow.

**Conclusion:** Direct deployment of Vyper smart contracts to zkSync using the integrated ZKSYNC plugin within the Remix IDE is not feasible at this time due to the plugin's lack of Vyper support. To deploy ZKVyper contracts, we must utilize alternative toolchains outside of this specific Remix plugin, such as Python-based frameworks like Moccasin and Titanoboa, which provide the necessary compilation and deployment capabilities. These alternative methods will be explored in subsequent lessons.
