## Congratulations & Share Your Success!

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your very first smart contract – a significant milestone in your Web3 development journey. Reaching this point takes effort, and it's an achievement worth celebrating and sharing.

Engaging with the broader Web3 community is a crucial aspect of learning and growing in this space. A large and active part of this community resides on X (formerly Twitter). Sharing your progress not only marks your accomplishment but also helps you connect with fellow developers, potential collaborators, and key figures in the ecosystem.

To make sharing easy, we've prepared a simple way for you to announce your success.

1.  **Navigate to the Course Repository:** Go back to the main page of the course's GitHub repository (e.g., Moccasin Full Course Repo / Vyper Full Course Repo).
2.  **Find the Sharing Link:** Within the repository structure, locate the "Vyper 101" section, and specifically within "Section 1: Welcome to Remix - Favorite's List". You will find a link explicitly labeled: `Tweet Me (add your contract in!)`.
3.  **Click to Tweet:** Clicking this link utilizes X's "Tweet Intent" feature. It will automatically open the X compose window in your browser, pre-filled with a celebratory message.

The pre-filled tweet text will look like this:

```
I just deployed a Smart Contract! Thanks @PatrickAlphaC, @zksyncdevs, and @cyfrinupdraft!
```

This message thanks:
*   `@PatrickAlphaC`: Acknowledging the course instructor/creator.
*   `@zksyncdevs`: Giving credit to relevant technology teams potentially used or discussed in the course.
*   `@cyfrinupdraft`: Tagging the learning platform hosting the course.

**Optional Addition:** Feel free to customize the tweet further. For instance, you might consider adding a thank you to `@TenderlyApp` if their tools, like their faucet for obtaining testnet ETH, were helpful during your deployment process.
