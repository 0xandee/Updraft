### Introduction

At Cyfrin, we're committed to providing the best tools and platforms to excel as smart contract developer. This course is proudly sponsored by ZK Sync, a leading solution we believe in and use ourselves. Here's why we're choosing ZK Sync Era, a layer 2 ZK roll-up, for our smart contract deployment throughout this course.

### Key Reasons to Use ZK Sync Era

🔒 **Security**: ZK Sync Era inherits its security directly from Ethereum. This means if Ethereum detects an issue and rolls back, ZK Sync Era will follow. Transactions are legitimate and authentic thanks to cryptographic validity proofs.

🛠️ **EVM Compatibility**: ZK Sync Era is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Although it compiles smart contracts into Era VM bytecode rather than EVM bytecode, this transition is seamless. You can deploy your Solidity-written smart contracts on ZK Sync Era with minimal adjustments.

🔑 **Ethereum Wallet Support**: ZK Sync supports Ethereum wallets out of the box. You can continue using your existing Ethereum wallet, like MetaMask, without creating a new one. Your address remains the same across both Ethereum and ZK Sync Era, simplifying your user experience.

💸 **Low Cost and Scalability**: One of the standout features of ZK Sync Era is its low transaction costs due to the transactions bundling. This not only reduces gas fees but also ensures scalability as the network grows. By deploying on ZK Sync, your protocol will remain efficient and cost-effective even as the number of users increase.

### Conclusion

These four key reasons—security, EVM compatibility, wallet support, and low cost—make ZK Sync Era a superior choice for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.
