## Flash Leverage: Closing a Leveraged Position

Letâ€™s discuss how to close a leveraged position using flash loans. Remember that this user has borrowed a stablecoin and has collateral locked in Aave.

To close the position, this user needs to:

1. Get a flash loan of the stablecoin
2. Use the stablecoin to repay the debt
3. Unlock the collateral, which includes the collateral that the user bought and the initial amount of collateral deposited
4. Sell collateral on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap
5. Repay the flash loan.

After selling the collateral and repaying the flash loan, the remaining amount is the profit that the user will receive. The user can also unlock the initial amount of collateral that was locked.
