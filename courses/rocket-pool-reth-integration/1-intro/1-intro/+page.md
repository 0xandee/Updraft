## Rocket Pool rETH Integration: Course Intro

Welcome to the course on Rocket Pool rETH Integration! This course is designed for Solidity developers with experience using Foundry, who have experience writing Foundry tests and executing them against the main network, and possess a basic understanding of DeFi concepts. For instance, familiarity with terms like DAI, WETH, and AMM is expected.

In this course, we will cover:

- rETH Architecture
- rETH / ETH exchange rate
- Flash Leverage
- Aave V3, Balancer V2, EigenLayer

We will explore the contracts interacting with the rETH token contract, as well as rETH to ETH exchange rates with supporting math and examples, and Foundry exercises.

Furthermore, you will learn to create a leveraged position for rETH using flash loans. We will explain the concept of leverage and how to use flash loans to establish a leveraged position.

This course is focused on integrating rETH into other smart contracts and DeFi protocols. You'll gain experience working with Aave V3, Balancer V2, and EigenLayer through practical integrations.

Why should you take this course? You'll learn how to integrate rETH into your smart contracts and gain experience with other DeFi protocols. Additionally, if you're interested in audits and bug bounties, you'll gain experience with famous DeFi protocols. This knowledge may help you in your audit or bug bounties.
