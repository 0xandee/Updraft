## What is rETH?

rETH is a liquid staking token issued by Rocket Pool.

Typically, the value of rETH increases with time. For example, if Alice deposits 1 ETH into the Rocket Pool contract, she may get back 0.83 rETH. The exchange rate is not one-to-one because rETH is usually more valuable than ETH.

## Value of rETH

rETH increases in value relative to ETH because it accumulates staking rewards.
Of course, if the node operators of the Rocket Pool are penalized for some kind of misbehavior, then the value of rETH can decrease relative to ETH. Assuming that the node operators of the Rocket Pool are performing well, then rETH will increase relative to ETH.

Here is an equation to visualize this:

```solidity
ETH / rETH = Amount of ETH backing 1 rETH
```

For example, 1 rETH might be worth 1.2 ETH. The exchange rate of ETH per rETH is the amount of ETH backing 1 rETH.

We can plot this on a graph to see visually how the value of rETH increases relative to ETH. On the vertical axis, we will plot the exchange rate of 1 rETH to ETH. On the horizontal axis, we will plot time. Time moves from left to right.

Assuming that the value of rETH increases relative to the value of ETH, here is what the graph will look like:

Over time, the value of rETH increases. You may notice that the value of rETH is not a straight line going up. Instead, it looks like a stairâ€”it would jump up, be flat for a while, and then jump up again. The reason is, when the Rocket Pool protocol updates its exchange rate, you will see the value of rETH increase.
