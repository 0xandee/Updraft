## Balancer UI Walkthrough

Let's take an example of providing liquidity to Balancer V2. The first step is to click on Pools. In this example, we will provide liquidity to the rETH wETH pool. Once you are on the pool page, scroll down, and let's look for the rETH wETH pool. We see it here. Click on it. Then, you can add liquidity by clicking on Add liquidity, and putting in the amount of rETH and ETH or wETH that you want to provide as liquidity.

Balancer allows you to single-side liquidity, which means that you don't have to provide both tokens. If you wish, you can choose to provide just one of them. I've already added liquidity, so scrolling down, here's the liquidity that I provided to this pool. Remember that once you provide liquidity, you get a BPT token, and you can use this BPT token to stake into the liquidity gauge. You can do this by clicking on Stake. I've already done it, so I cannot press it here.

Clicking on the Staked tab, you can see that I have my BPT token staked into the liquidity gauge. Once you have BPT staked into the liquidity gauge, over time you'll earn some BAL token rewards. Once you have BAL, you can claim the BAL reward and then pair it with a wETH to add liquidity to the BAL wETH pool. Then, you will take that LP token and lock it into the voting escrow contract. To claim the BAL reward, click on the veBAL tab. This will take you to another page. Once you're there, click on the Claim tab.

Scrolling down, here, you can see that I can claim some BAL as rewards. Click on this to claim some BAL tokens as reward, and once you have this, you can add this as liquidity to the BAL wETH pool. Then, lock the BPT into the voting escrow contract.

Going back to the Balancer Pool page, scroll down, and then find the pool called BAL wETH. Click on this, and then add your liquidity by clicking on Add liquidity. Again, you can either single-side liquidity or add both tokens as liquidity. Once you do that, we'll again go back to the page of veBAL. I've already locked some BPT for the BAL wETH pool. And you can see here that my veBAL is 0.350, and over time it will decrease.

Furthermore, if I scroll down, you can see that I can vote for the next BAL emission. For example, I voted for the wETH rETH pool. Then, let's go back to the Claim tab again. Scrolling down, here, you can see that I am also eligible to receive protocol revenues.
