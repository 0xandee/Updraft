## Project Setup

We're back in our `mox-cu` folder. Let's do a little `ls` to see what we've built so far:

```bash
ls
```

We're building up a nice little folder here filled with demo projects that we're using to level up our career. Let's go ahead and make the next folder. We'll do `mkdir` and name this new folder `mox-buy-me-a-coffee-cu`.

```bash
mkdir mox-buy-me-a-coffee-cu
```

Then, we'll `cd` into that folder.

```bash
cd mox-buy-me-a-coffee-cu
```

Now, we can open this folder in our code editor. We'll do `code .`.

```bash
code .
```

We already know that we have `mox --help` and `mox` installed. We're going to initialize our new project using `mox init`. We want to use VS Code, so we'll pass in the flag `--vscode`, and we'll use a `pyproject` file, so we'll pass in the `--pyproject` flag as well:

```bash
mox init --vscode --pyproject
```

Now, we'll delete the files that were created in this directory so we can start from a blank project. We can just right-click, then click "delete" and "move to trash".

To get our starting code for this project, we'll use the code from the "Buy Me A Coffee" section in the Remix Fundamentals video. We'll go over to our GitHub repository, open `remix-buy-me-a-coffee-cu` and then open the `buy-me-a-coffee.vy` file. We're going to bring this code into our `mox-buy-me-a-coffee-cu` directory. We can copy it and paste it into a new file. We can right-click, select "New File", and name it `buy-me-a-coffee.vy`:

```python
# pragma version ^0.4.0
"""
@license MIT
@title Buy Me A Coffee!
@author You!
@notice This contract is for creating a sample funding contract

We'll learn a new way to do interfaces later...

    price: int256 = staticcall(PRICE_FEED.latestAnswer())
    eth_price: uint256 = convert(price, price * eth_amount) * (10 ** 10)

```

Now, we'll compile the code. We'll use `mox compile` to do that.

```bash
mox compile
```

We have successfully compiled the contract.
