## Private Key Promise

We learned that we should never place our private keys directly in our scripts or in plaintext. This is a serious risk. We could lose all of our money if someone got their hands on our private keys. 

We need to protect our private keys. The best way to do this is to encrypt them and store them in a secure location. We should never share even our encrypted private keys.

We can create a file called `promise.md` to remind ourselves of this important promise. Here's what we should write in the file:

```text
I promise to never place my plaintext private key associated with real money anywhere.
I will always encrypt my private keys and never share even the encrypted keys.
```

This is a good practice to follow. It's always better to be safe than sorry!
