## Visual Studio Code Quickstart 1: Terminals & Git

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and popular text editor. One of the things that makes it so powerful is its built-in terminal feature.

### Terminals

VS Code's terminal lets us run scripts from within the text editor. It's essentially a command-line prompt.

To open a terminal, we can:

1. Click the "Terminal" menu and select "New Terminal."
2. Use the keyboard shortcut **ctrl backtick** on Mac or Linux, which will toggle the terminal on and off.

### Git

We will be using Git to manage our code projects. Git is a version control system that lets us track changes to our code and collaborate with others.

We need to install Git before we can use it. To install Git on Linux, use one of these commands:

```bash
sudo dnf install git-all
```

```bash
sudo apt install git-all
```

On macOS, we can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

This will prompt us to install Git if it's not already installed. We can also use a macOS Git installer by clicking the link to a Git installer on the [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) website.

We will go over how to use Git in detail in future lessons. For now, we can skip the next two sections of this course if we're not planning on using Windows or GitPod.
