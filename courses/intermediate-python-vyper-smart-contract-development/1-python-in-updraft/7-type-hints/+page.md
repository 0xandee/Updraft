## Type Hints

Additionally, in Python we can use something called type hints. We can say:

```python
my_typed_number: int = 9
```
This colon and then int is known as a type hint. It's more helpful for humans to know that anytime you see my typed number, that's going to be an integer or a number. We could also say:

```python
my_typed_bool: bool = False
```

```python
my_typed_string: str = "hi"
```

So str is a type hint for a string, bool is a type hint for a boolean which is a true or false. Int is a type hint for an integer, a.k.a a number. You can also update variables. So my variable originally starts off as 7.

```python
my_variable = 7
```

We can copy this value, paste it here, and then we can update it to 77.

```python
my_variable = 77
```
