## Comments in Vyper

We're going to talk about comments in Vyper.

This little hashtag here is, or pound symbol, makes this whole line here, what's known as a comment.

```python
# pragma version 0.4.0
```

And typically, a comment is a line in your code where you can write pretty much whatever you want, and the compiler will ignore it. The compiler doesn't ignore these lines if it sees a comment.

```python
# asdfagolsa asdfasrtafdsdf
```

We can also use comments to leave ourselves notes, like this:

```python
# This is how we tell the Vyper compiler
# what version to use
# pragma version 0.4.0
```

We can also copy and paste these comments into a text editor or a notes app so that we can refer to them later.

It is important to save our work frequently, because if we lose our tab, we'll lose all of our text.
