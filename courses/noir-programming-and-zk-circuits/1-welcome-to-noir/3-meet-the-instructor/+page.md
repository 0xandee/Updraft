## Meet Your Instructor

Welcome! Before we dive into the core material of this course, I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself. For those of you who might already know me, hello again! And for those who don't, well, perhaps you should have caught the "Fundamentals of Zero-Knowledge Proofs" course!

Joking aside, my name is Ciara Nightingale, and I'll be your guide through this learning journey.

So, who exactly am I? Let's cover some of the key details:

*   **Name & Role:** I'm Ciara Nightingale, and I serve as a lead instructor here at Cyfrin.
*   **Connect with Me:** You can find me on social media.
    *   On **Twitter/X**, I'm **@ciaranightingal**. Please note, there's no "e" at the end of Nightingale there â€“ it simply didn't fit!
    *   On **YouTube**, you can find me at **@ciaranightingale**.
*   **Experience:** I've had the pleasure of building more than 10 hours of educational content for Cyfrin Updraft, Cyfrin's learning platform.
*   **Education:** I hold a degree in Physics from the University of Bath.

Now, you might be wondering why I bring up my physics background. Occasionally, people ask about my qualifications for creating and teaching courses like this. While my academic background provides a certain foundation, I believe what's truly at my core is that I'm a cryptography nerd who genuinely loves to research things. My primary aim is to take the knowledge I've painstakingly gathered and share it effectively with all of you.

That's a brief overview of who I am. With introductions out of the way, our next step will be to walk through the GitHub repository for this course. This walkthrough is designed to help you understand how to navigate all the materials effectively, ensuring you can make the most out of your learning experience with us.
