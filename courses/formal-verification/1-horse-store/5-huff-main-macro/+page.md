title: Huff MAIN macro
---

---

In the realm of Huff, this entry point is interpreted as `main` inside the binary. Essentially, `main` in the binary becomes the recipient of your call data and orchestrates its execution.

Now, if you feel a bit overwhelmed by the barrage of terminology, hang in there with me. I promise it'll all start making a lot more sense as we delve deeper.

> "Understanding the entry points for smart contract call data is the first step to mastering Huff for smart contract design."

Let's discuss coding this idea of function dispatching. For Huff to process our call data, we must define a function—let's name it `main`—which will serve as the command center for this interaction.

Huff does have native functions, yet we'll veer away from declaring specific functions in favor of employing macros. In spirit, macros are analogous to functions, albeit with some nuanced differences (which we won't fuss over at this juncture). We're aiming to craft a `main` function that'll spearhead the function dispatching process.

You might recall that in Solidity—one of the predominant programming languages for Ethereum smart contracts—this manual function dispatching isn't necessary. However, in Huff, this step is crucial, and what's more, understanding it in Huff sheds light on how it operates at the bytecode level. And so, it's time to turn our attention to crafting this `main` function — or should I say, macro.

```huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes (0) returns (0) {}
```

Above, we see how a macro is defined in Huff. The skeleton of our `main` macro is outlined with the `takes` and `returns` syntax specifying the stack operations it will perform—but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Whoops! A minor hiccup—remember, the macro has to be named `MAIN` in uppercase. With that minor tweak, our main macro is all set for action.

To validate our setup, we can compile our Huff code. By running `huffc` on our source file:

```bash
huffc src/horsestore/v1/horsestore.huff
```

If all goes well, we're greeted by silence—no news is good news, indicating a successful compilation.

Curious to see the bytecode? Run the command with a `-b` flag:

```bash
huffc -b src/horsestore/v1/horsestore.huff
```

And we're rewarded with a generated sequence of bytecode, the intricate tapestry of opcodes that breathes life into our smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

And voilà! Our minimal Huff smart contract, encoded in its purest form. We've sculpted the smallest, most fundamental contract possible, and in essence, we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of Huff's capabilities.

This journey through function dispatching in Huff may seem daunting at first but glimpsing the underlying mechanics grants us invaluable insight. It draws back the curtain on the enchanting world of smart contract development at the bytecode level—an esoteric skill set for the aspiring blockchain developer.

As we navigate through the intricacies of defining macros, dispatching functions, and understanding stack operations in Huff, we gain not just knowledge, but also a profound appreciation for the art and science of smart contract creation.

Stick with me, and I'll ensure that the winding paths of Huff become as familiar to you as the well-trodden roads of more traditional programming practices. Until then, happy coding, and may your smart contract adventures be fruitful and bug-free!

In a way, us sending call data to a smart contract is going to be the same as us calling like a python script or a JavaScript script. And we need an entry point for our call data to be processed in huff. We call that entry point main in the binary. It'll just take your call data and execute it through whatever binary is there. But we'll talk about that in a bit. And again, I know I'm throwing a lot of terminology at you here, but I promise it'll make sense. Just follow along with me for now. We're going to really dial this in for you.
