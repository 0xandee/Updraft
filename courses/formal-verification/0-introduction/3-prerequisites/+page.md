Before we dive into the meat of the course, let's take a moment to talk about the prerequisites – the non-negotiables you'll need under your belt if you plan to get the most out of our training. This isn't a beginner's playground, after all. It's a challenging course designed to propel intermediate learners into the ranks of top smart contract developers and security researchers. But don't worry, we've got your back every step of the way.

### Solidifying Your Foundations in Solidity

Solidity isn't just a buzzword here – it's the cornerstone of everything you're about to learn. A very solid grasp of this programming language is your first ticket to this course.

#### The Foundry Factor

Next up, let's talk about Foundry. Ideally, you should be as comfortable with Foundry as a fish in water. For those of you hearing about Foundry for the first time - it's an Ethereum development environment, and it's rapidly becoming a staple in the smart contract universe.

#### Security and Auditing: Your Educational Armor

Have you breezed through the security and auditing course on Cyfrin Updraft? No? Well, I highly recommend you do. It's like a Swiss Army knife of skills, and you'll want every single one of them by your side.

### The Developer's Toolkit Essentials

Let's make sure your toolbox is fully stocked:

- **Foundry vs. Code**: Or essentially, some type of text editor where your code takes shape.
- **Git**: At least knowing how to do git clones is necessary. We're not climbing Everest here, but Git is the oxygen tank you can't afford to ignore.
- **Terminal Commands**: Some basic Unix or Linux terminal commands are needed. Consider these as your smart contract developer's compass.
- **GitHub**: Or any cloud git provider. Think of it as your code's home away from home.
- **WSL for Windows Warriors**: If you're on a Windows machine, WSL should be your sidekick.

No tools? No problem. We have a link in the GitHub repo and in the written lessons to the Cyfrin Updraft tutorials to install these tools. So, take a break from this video if you must, get those downloads running, and if you're feeling particularly ambitious, do a re-run of the courses where these tools make their cameo.

### From Intermediate to Elite: The Journey Begins

Ready for a challenge? Great, because that's exactly what's ahead. This course isn't just about leveling up – it's about detonating your knowledge base, taking you from intermediate to advanced, right into the top 1% of smart contract developers or security researchers.

### Section Dive: The Horse Store

We're about to explore our first section - the infamous Horse Store.

> But first, a quick reminder: this is a jump, not a gentle step up. Make sure those prerequisites are more than just checked boxes; they should be your well-worn tools.

## Course Essentials Checklist

Before you move forward, let's ensure all systems are go. Here's a quick checklist:

- \[ \] **Solid grasp on Solidity?** ✔️
- \[ \] **Buttery smooth with Foundry?** ✔️
- \[ \] **Security and auditing course cleared on Cyfrin Updraft?** ✔️ (Highly recommended!)
- \[ \] **Text editor?** (VS Code or similar) ✔️
- \[ \] **Git, GitHub/cloud git provider?** ✔️
- \[ \] **Basic Unix or Linux terminal know-how?** ✔️
- \[ \] **Working with WSL on Windows?** ✔️

Each check is a step closer to becoming that sharp coder or prudent security expert you aim to be.

## Installation Station: Setting Up Your Development Environment

If you found yourself unable to check off any of the essentials above, here's what you need to do:

1. **Pause**: This is your pit stop before the race resumes.
2. **Download and Install**: Visit the Cyfrin Updraft tutorials through our provided links and follow the guides.
3. **Education Rerun**: Consider revisiting the courses that shine the spotlight on these tools.

It's a detour worth taking. The smoother your setup, the more frictionless your learning experience will be.

### Wrapping It Up

Let's get ready to rumble in the realms of smart contract development and security research. Remember, the difference between good and great is the prep work and the willingness to challenge yourself. Take this journey seriously, and you're bound to reap the rewards. So strap in, prep hard, and let's turn you into a coding warrior of the blockchain arena.

This is not the end, but rather the spectacular beginning of your ascent to the top 1%. And with that, let's gear up and dive into the cosmos of codes and contracts — welcome to the Horse Store, your first gateway to greatness.
