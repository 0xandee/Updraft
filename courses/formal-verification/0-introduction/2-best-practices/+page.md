## Essential Course Resources

Every great course begins with great resources, and ours is no different. Right at the starting gate, we’ve provided you with a treasure trove of materials. The GitHub resources link that accompanies this course is your primary toolkit – it houses all the links and resources you'll need. Trust me, bookmark this link; it'll be your best friend!

### The Discussions Tab: Your Go-To for Queries

Got questions? Perfect! That's what the discussions tab is all about. It's the perfect spot to reach out to teaching assistants, peers, and possibly me. No matter where you're viewing the course, the discussions link remains the same, readily available for your queries. YouTube viewers, just scroll down to the video description, and you'll find what you need.

### Real-Time Course Creation

Here's the unique bit – I’m building this course as I’m recording it. It’s like you’re right there with me as each lesson takes shape. When you click on the GitHub resources section in each lesson, you'll be whisked away to the realms of our GitHub page, filled with all the projects and codebases you’ll encounter throughout the course. And yes, Updraft users, written lessons are there for you too, updated in tandem with each video.

### Engage and Learn in Our Community

When it comes to collaboration and community, our course thrives on interaction. By clicking the links at the bottom of each video, you’ll find yourself in our bustling GitHub discussions and Discord channel, where other students are ready to chat, discuss, and provide insights that only a vibrant student community can.

### Asking the Right Questions

Not sure how to frame your query? No worries. I have a detailed guide on ‘how to ask a question’ (and ‘how to answer’ one too), ensuring you get the most out of our community's collective brainpower. Leverage the lesson in Cypher Updraft that delves into this topic, and sharpen your question-asking prowess.

### Stay Current: The Need for Updates

In the fast-paced tech world, staying up-to-date is crucial, and our course is designed to help you do just that. Each lesson on Cypher Updraft features an updates section, so if there's a change in best practices or tool updates, we've got you covered. Keep an eye out for this section:

If you suspect a video might be outdated, check the updates or pop over to GitHub discussions before making any conclusions. Chances are, you might just need to tweak your code a bit.

### Coding Along: A Hands-On Approach

Coding alongside a video? Highly recommended! It’s a great way to internalize the lesson. Plus, remember to take breaks – your brain needs them to absorb information better. Don’t rush; a steady pace befits the complexity of smart contract development. Don’t worry about how long it takes. What matters is consistency and comprehension, not speed.

### Customize Your Learning Experience

Feel like I'm talking in fast-forward or slow-motion? Adjust the playback speed to your liking, both on YouTube and Cypher Updraft, ensuring you’re learning at a pace that suits you. And for those who prefer or require subtitles, we've got a multitude of languages covered, with the option to contribute more!

### Dive Deep, Reflect, Repeat

Here, each lesson comes with a challenge – an optional NFT mint on a Layer 2, which you use to claim a badge, a testament to your newfound skills. Reflecting on each lesson and practicing will solidify your understanding. This isn't just about the tech; it's about the collaborative spirit of blockchain development and the open-source ethos.

### The Power of Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing

Leverage resources beyond the course syllabus. Engage in GitHub discussions, scour the Ethereum Stack Exchange, participate in decentralized forums, raise issues on GitHub projects, and don't shy away from exploring the potentials of artificial intelligence. Remember, collaborating and knowing where to find information are skills just as vital as your smart contract expertise.

### Written Lessons for Quiet Study

And if you ever find my voice grating after binge-watching lessons (I hope not), rest assured – there are written lessons available for every single video. Reading these can give you that extra bit of context, nuance, and quiet study time that videos sometimes can't offer.

Embarking on this course is more than just learning about smart contracts; it’s about becoming part of an engaging, evolving, and incredibly supportive community. It's about practical skills, asking the right questions, and building a robust learning foundation that will serve you not just for this course but for an exciting career in blockchain technology.

So, whether you’re programming your future in smart contracts, enhancing collaboration skills, or just enriching your tech knowledge, this course is for you. Welcome aboard – let’s code, learn, and grow!
