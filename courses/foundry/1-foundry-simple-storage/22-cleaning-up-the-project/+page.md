### Formatting and README files

Almost there!

But there are still a couple of things we need to do. **One of them is formatting.**

There are multiple ways to format code, and everyone has certain a preference. But consistency is key. Foundry comes to our aid with a command that autoformats our solidity code.

Type the following command in your terminal:

```
forge fmt
```

This way all our solidity codes will be formatted the same!

**The other one is having a strong README**

Create a `README.md` file in the root folder of your project. This file contains any relevant information about your project like instructions, additional details about functions/interactions, your contact details, instructions for collaboration if your project is open source, etc.

README files are formatted using Markdown. Copy the following in your README.md file:

```
# This is a title
## This is a subtitle

- This is a bullet point
- Another bullet point

```

Markdown is versatile. There are numerous tutorials where you can learn how to properly format your .md documents. I recommend going through one of these:

1. [Basic writing and formatting syntax by Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
2. [Basic Syntax by Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

You can do `CTRL(CMD) + SHIFT + V` to open a preview of the `.md` document you are currently working on.

*Fun fact: All these lessons are `.md` files!*
