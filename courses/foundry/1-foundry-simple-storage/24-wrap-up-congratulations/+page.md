### Recap

We learned to use the following:

`forge init` - To create our Foundry project;

`forge` is mainly used to compile, deploy and test our contracts;

`cast` is used to interact with our already deployed contract and, on top of that, comes with a lot of useful tools for converting;

`anvil` is the local blockchain that you can start at the press of a button;

We learned what a transaction is and how to send a transaction to an RPC URL, which is mainly an HTTP Post request. 

We learned how to obtain a Sepolia RPC URL from a Node as a Service provider like Alchemy. We learned to compile and deploy a contract on Sepolia. We did this via Scripting. We also manually verified the contract on Etherscan to facilitate the interaction with it via our browser and MetaMask.

**One of the most important things we learned is how to manage our private key and we took a pledge to never keep our private key associated with real money in plain sight.**

We learned how to use `cast` to send transactions and read information from a public blockchain.

We learned how to format our code using `forge fmt`. Moreover, we learned some about properly formatting a `README.md` document.

With these tools in your web development arsenal, you've performed exceptionally well â€“ and yes, you should be incredibly proud. Remember, even something as small as installing tools like Vs code and Foundry can pose great difficulties, so, you're doing fantastic.

Take a breather. Remember, breaks enhance productivity. Till next time, continue to strive for greatness in every line of code you write!

**There's a lot more to go, but you've made the first steps! Stay froggy! See you on the next one!**
