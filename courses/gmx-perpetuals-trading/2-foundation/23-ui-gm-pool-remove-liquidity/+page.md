Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video clip (0:00-1:45) about removing liquidity from a GMX V2 GM Pool:

**Video Summary: Removing Liquidity from a GMX V2 GM Pool (ETH/USD)**

The video demonstrates the process of removing liquidity (selling GM tokens) from a specific GMX V2 Generalized Market (GM) Pool.

**1. Initiating the Liquidity Removal:**

*   **Action:** The user navigates the "Select a GM Pool" interface. They locate the `ETH/USD [WETH-USDC]` pool.
*   **UI Element:** To remove liquidity, the user clicks the "Sell" button associated with the `ETH/USD [WETH-USDC]` pool row.

**2. The "Sell GM" Interface:**

*   **Context:** Clicking "Sell" opens a dedicated interface for selling GM tokens specific to the selected pool (`GM: ETH/USD [WETH-USDC]`).
*   **Pool Composition:** The interface shows the current composition of the pool:
    *   Long WETH: 14.827k (50.55%)
    *   Short USDC: 28.128m (49.45%)
*   **User Action:** The user decides to remove *all* their liquidity from this pool.
*   **UI Interaction:** They click the "MAX" button next to the "Pay" input field. This automatically populates the field with their entire wallet balance of `GM: ETH/USD` tokens, which is `1.3982...` (valued at $1.93).
*   **Expected Outcome:** The interface calculates and displays the *estimated* amounts of the underlying tokens the user will receive in exchange for their GM tokens:
    *   Receive: `~0.957...` USDC (worth ~$0.95)
    *   Receive: `~0.000504...` ETH (worth ~$0.97)

**3. Key Concept: Proportional Withdrawal:**

*   **Explanation:** The narrator explicitly states that when removing liquidity (selling GM tokens), there is *no option* to receive only one of the underlying tokens (e.g., only USDC or only ETH).
*   **Mechanism:** Liquidity removal *always* results in receiving *both* constituent tokens of the market (WETH and USDC in this case).
*   **Ratio:** The amounts received are proportional to the current composition/weighting of those assets within the specific GM pool at the time of withdrawal.

**4. Fees Involved in Removal:**

*   **Sell Fee:** A fee is charged for selling GM tokens (removing liquidity).
    *   *Value Shown:* 0.069% of the sell amount. In this example, it's calculated as `<$0.01`.
    *   *Nature:* This appears to be a protocol fee associated directly with the withdrawal action.
*   **Fees and Price Impact:** This section shows the combined potential cost of fees and slippage.
    *   *Value Shown:* `<$0.01`.
*   **Network Fee:** This is the standard blockchain transaction fee (gas cost).
    *   *Value Shown:* ~$0.04.
    *   *Nature:* This fee pays the network validators/miners to process the transaction(s) on the blockchain (Arbitrum One in this case, indicated by the wallet pop-up).

**5. Key Concept: Price Impact Explanation (Q&A):**

*   **Question (Implied):** Why isn't there a significant "Price Impact" fee, unlike swaps?
*   **Answer:** Price impact is zero or negligible because the liquidity is being removed *in proportion* to the pool's existing asset composition (roughly 50.55% WETH and 49.45% USDC).
*   **Reasoning:** Since the user is taking out WETH and USDC in the same ratio as they currently exist in the pool, this action *does not change* the relative balance or price curve of the pool. Therefore, there's no slippage or price impact cost typically associated with altering pool balances during a swap.

**6. Example Provided:**

*   **Scenario:** If a user had $100 worth of GM tokens for this specific pool composition (approx. 50.5% WETH / 49.5% USDC).
*   **Outcome:** Upon removing liquidity, they would receive approximately:
    *   $50.54 worth of WETH
    *   $49.46 worth of USDC
*   **Purpose:** This example reinforces that the withdrawal reflects the pool's current asset ratio, thus causing no price impact.

**7. Transaction Process:**

*   **Mechanism:** The narrator mentions that removing liquidity (selling GM) involves *two transactions*:
    1.  **Create Order:** The first transaction submits the request to sell the GM tokens.
    2.  **Execute Order:** The second transaction executes the actual withdrawal after the order is processed (likely by GMX keepers/backend).
*   **Note:** This two-step process is common in GMX for asynchronous operations to manage gas costs and execution timing.

**8. Executing the Transaction:**

*   **Action:** The user clicks the "Sell GM" button.
*   **Wallet Interaction:** A MetaMask wallet confirmation pop-up appears, showing the estimated gas fee (`0.000018 ETH`) and asking for confirmation.
*   **Confirmation:** The user clicks "Confirm" in MetaMask.

**9. Outcome and Verification:**

*   **Notification:** A success notification appears on the GMX interface:
    *   "Selling GM: ETH/USD [WETH-USDC]"
    *   "Sell request sent"
    *   "Sell order executed"
*   **Interface Update:** The user's wallet balance of `GM: ETH/USD` tokens in the interface updates to `0.0000` ($0.00). The balances for received USDC and ETH in their wallet would also update (though the ETH change is very small).
*   **Final Check:** The user navigates back to the main "Earn" page and scrolls down to the "Select a GM Pool" list.
*   **Verification:** For the `ETH/USD [WETH-USDC]` pool row, the "Wallet" column now shows `-` (or 0), confirming that they no longer hold any GM tokens for this pool, indicating the liquidity removal was successful.

**Code Blocks, Links, Resources:**

*   **Code Blocks:** No specific code blocks were shown or discussed in the video clip.
*   **Links/Resources:** No external links or resources were mentioned.

In essence, the clip clearly illustrates how to withdraw liquidity from a GMX V2 pool, emphasizing that the withdrawal is proportional to the pool's assets and explaining why this results in zero price impact, while detailing the associated fees and transaction steps.
