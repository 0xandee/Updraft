Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video "4 types of open interest" as tracked by the GMX protocol.

**Overall Summary**

The video introduces and explains the four distinct categories of open interest (OI) that the GMX protocol tracks for its perpetual markets. Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (long or short) that have not been settled. GMX specifically differentiates this OI based on two factors: 1) whether the position is long or short, and 2) whether the collateral backing the position is the "long token" or the "short token" for that specific market. The video lists these four types and then provides concrete examples using an ETH market where WETH is the long token and USDC is the short token.

**Key Concepts Discussed**

1.  **Open Interest (OI):** The total value or number of unsettled derivative contracts (in this case, perpetual futures positions on GMX).
2.  **GMX Protocol:** The decentralized perpetual exchange where these OI types are tracked.
3.  **Long Position:** A bet that the price of the index asset will increase.
4.  **Short Position:** A bet that the price of the index asset will decrease.
5.  **Collateral:** Assets deposited by a trader to open and maintain a leveraged position.
6.  **Long Token (as Collateral):** In a specific GMX market (e.g., ETH WETH/USDC), this is the token designated as the "long" collateral option, typically the asset itself or a derivative of it (like WETH for ETH). Its value usually moves *with* the index asset.
7.  **Short Token (as Collateral):** In a specific GMX market (e.g., ETH WETH/USDC), this is the token designated as the "short" collateral option, typically a stablecoin (like USDC). Its value is stable or moves *inversely* (less common) relative to the index asset.
8.  **Index Token:** The underlying asset being traded (e.g., ETH).

**Relationship Between Concepts**

The four types of open interest arise from the combination of the position direction (Long/Short) and the type of collateral used (Long Token/Short Token). GMX tracks these separately because the risk profile and potential impact on the GLP (GMX Liquidity Provider token) pool differ depending on how positions are collateralized. For instance, a long position collateralized by the long token (e.g., Long ETH with WETH) has different dynamics than a long position collateralized by a stablecoin (e.g., Long ETH with USDC).

**The Four Types of Open Interest**

The video explicitly lists the following four types:

1.  **Long open interest with long token as collateral:** Traders are betting on the price going up, and their collateral is the token associated with the long side of the market pair.
2.  **Long open interest with short token as collateral:** Traders are betting on the price going up, and their collateral is the token associated with the short side of the market pair (usually a stablecoin).
3.  **Short open interest with long token as collateral:** Traders are betting on the price going down, and their collateral is the token associated with the long side of the market pair.
4.  **Short open interest with short token as collateral:** Traders are betting on the price going down, and their collateral is the token associated with the short side of the market pair (usually a stablecoin).

**Examples and Use Cases**

The video provides specific examples based on an **ETH WETH/USDC market**:

*   **Index Token:** ETH
*   **Long Token:** WETH (Wrapped Ether)
*   **Short Token:** USDC (USD Coin - a stablecoin)

The examples given for each type are:

1.  **Type 1 Example:** *Long ETH with WETH collateral.* (Matches: Long open interest with long token as collateral).
2.  **Type 2 Example:** *Long ETH with USDC collateral.* (Matches: Long open interest with short token as collateral).
3.  **Type 3 Example:** *Short ETH with WETH collateral.* (Matches: Short open interest with long token as collateral).
4.  **Type 4 Example:** *Short ETH with USDC collateral.* (Matches: Short open interest with short token as collateral).
