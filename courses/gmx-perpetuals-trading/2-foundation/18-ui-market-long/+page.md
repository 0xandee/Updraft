Okay, here is a detailed summary of the video walkthrough on creating a long position on the GMX platform:

**Video Summary: Creating a Long Position on GMX**

The video provides a step-by-step guide on how to initiate a leveraged long position on the GMX decentralized perpetual exchange, using the ETH/USD market as an example.

**1. Understanding a Long Position (0:00 - 0:06)**
*   A "Long" position means the trader is betting that the price of the underlying asset (in this case, ETH) will *increase* above the price at which they entered the position.

**2. Initiating the Long Position (0:06 - 0:26)**
*   **Navigation:** The user navigates to the trading interface and selects the "Long" tab.
*   **Order Type:** The video focuses on the "Market" order type, which means the position will be opened immediately at the current available market price. Other tabs like "Limit", "TP/SL" (Take Profit / Stop Loss) are visible but not explored in this segment.
*   **Entering Amount:** The user decides to "Pay" `0.01 ETH`. The interface shows the approximate USD value of this amount ($19.15 at the time).

**3. Understanding "Pay" vs. "Collateral" (0:26 - 0:51)**
*   **"Pay" Field:** This is the amount and type of token the user is *spending* from their wallet to open the position. Here, it's 0.01 ETH.
*   **"Collateral In" Dropdown:** This specifies which token will be held as collateral for the position *within GMX*.
    *   **Swap Scenario:** If the user pays ETH but selects "USDC" as collateral, GMX will automatically swap the paid ETH into USDC to use as collateral.
    *   **No Swap Scenario:** If the user pays ETH and selects "WETH" (Wrapped ETH) as collateral (as done at 0:45), the paid ETH is converted to WETH and used directly as collateral, avoiding an extra swap to a stablecoin. The video proceeds with WETH as the chosen collateral.

**4. Leverage (0:51 - 1:30)**
*   **Concept:** Leverage allows traders to open a position larger than their initial collateral. It magnifies both potential profits and potential losses.
*   **UI:** A slider allows selecting leverage from 1x up to 100x.
*   **Risk:** Higher leverage increases the risk of "Liquidation."
*   **Liquidation Price:** This is the price displayed below the main settings. If the asset's market price drops to this level (for a long position), the collateral will be automatically sold to cover the loss, closing the position.
*   **Leverage Impact:** The video demonstrates that as leverage increases, the Liquidation Price gets *closer* to the entry price, meaning the position can tolerate less adverse price movement before being liquidated.
    *   At 1x leverage, the liquidation price is low (~$1008).
    *   At higher leverage (e.g., 62.5x shown briefly), the liquidation price is much higher (~$1895).
*   **Example Setting:** The user sets the leverage to **2.00x** for this trade. The liquidation price updates to ~$1,312.

**5. Position Size (1:30 - 1:46)**
*   **Display:** The interface shows the total size of the long position in USD value under the "Long ETH/USD" label ($38.27 in the 2x leverage example).
*   **Calculation:** Position Size â‰ˆ (Collateral Value in USD) * Leverage.
    *   The 0.01 ETH paid (~$19.15) multiplied by 2x leverage results in the ~$38.27 position size.

**6. Pools, Open Interest, and Associated Fees (1:47 - 4:07)**
*   **Pool Selection:** The user can choose which GMX liquidity pool to trade against (e.g., WETH-USDC, WETH-WETH, WSTETH-USDE). The default shown is WETH-USDC.
*   **Pool Tokens:** The pool name (e.g., WETH-USDC) indicates the tokens within that specific pool used for internal balancing (WETH for long exposure, USDC for short exposure in this case).
*   **Open Interest (OI):** Displayed at the top (e.g., "Open Interest (51%/49%)" for the WETH-USDC pool). This shows the ratio of total value locked in long positions vs. short positions within that specific pool.
    *   WETH-USDC Pool: 51% Long, 49% Short. Longs > Shorts.
    *   WETH-WETH Pool (shown briefly): 42% Long, 58% Short. Shorts > Longs.
*   **Impact Fees:** Fees paid when a trade *increases* the imbalance between long and short OI. If you trade *with* the majority side, you pay an impact fee. If you trade *against* the majority (helping balance the pool), you might receive a rebate. In the WETH-USDC pool example, opening a long increases the long majority, incurring an impact fee (-0.10%).
*   **Funding Fees (Net Rate):** Periodic fees paid between long and short positions based on OI imbalance. The side with the *larger* OI pays the side with the *smaller* OI. The rate is displayed per hour (e.g., `/ 1h`).
    *   **Negative Rate:** You *pay* if you are on the side with the larger OI. (Example: WETH-USDC pool has -0.0023%/h; longs pay shorts because Long OI > Short OI).
    *   **Positive Rate:** You *receive* if you are on the side with the smaller OI. (Example: WETH-WETH pool has +0.0058%/h; shorts pay longs because Short OI > Long OI. Opening a long here would *earn* funding).

**7. Other Settings and Fees (4:07 - 4:43)**
*   **Take Profit / Stop Loss:** Options exist to set automatic closing prices but are *not* configured in this example. They will be covered later.
*   **Open Fee:** A one-time fee charged for opening the position, calculated as a percentage of the *position size* (not just collateral). In the example, it's 0.060% of the ~$38 position size, resulting in a fee of ~$0.02.
*   **Network Fee:** The estimated blockchain gas fee required to execute the transaction (estimated at ~$0.07). This is for the on-chain execution.

**8. Transaction Process (4:43 - 5:00)**
*   Opening a position (or any trade on GMX) involves **two** transactions:
    1.  **Order Request:** The user submits their trade parameters to the GMX contracts.
    2.  **Execution:** An authorized GMX keeper account executes the trade on the blockchain based on the request.

**9. Execution and Final Position (5:00 - 5:08)**
*   **Action:** The user clicks the "Long ETH" button.
*   **Confirmation:** A MetaMask wallet notification pops up for the user to confirm the *first* transaction (the order request), including the gas fee. The user confirms.
*   **Result:** After the transaction is processed (execution by the keeper is implied), the newly opened position appears under the "Positions" tab on the left side of the interface.
*   **Position Details Displayed:** Key information is shown, including:
    *   Asset/Pair: ETH/USD
    *   Leverage: 2.00x Long
    *   Pool: ETH/USD [WETH-USDC]
    *   Size: $38.28
    *   Net Value: $19.09 (current value of collateral + PnL)
    *   PnL After Fees: Shows profit or loss (initially slightly negative due to fees).
    *   Collateral: $19.13 (0.0099880 WETH)
    *   Entry Price: $1,917.50
    *   Mark Price: Current market price ($1,916.24)
    *   Liq. Price: $1,312.31

**Key Concepts Covered:**

*   **Long Position:** Betting on price increase.
*   **Market Order:** Execute at the current price.
*   **Leverage:** Trading with more capital than deposited collateral. Magnifies P/L and risk.
*   **Collateral:** Assets deposited to back the position.
*   **Liquidation:** Automatic closing of a position when losses reach a certain threshold relative to collateral.
*   **Open Interest (OI):** Total value held in open long vs. short positions in a pool.
*   **Funding Fees (Net Rate):** Payments between longs and shorts based on OI imbalance.
*   **Impact Fees:** Fees for increasing OI imbalance.
*   **Open Fee:** One-time fee based on position size.
*   **Network Fee:** Blockchain gas cost for execution.

**Important Notes/Tips:**

*   To avoid swapping your paid asset (e.g., ETH) into a different collateral asset (e.g., USDC), ensure the "Collateral In" dropdown matches the asset type you intend to use (e.g., WETH for ETH).
*   Higher leverage significantly increases liquidation risk by moving the liquidation price closer to the entry price.
*   Understand the OI balance in the chosen pool to anticipate whether you will pay or receive funding fees and if you will incur impact fees.
*   Opening a position requires confirming a transaction in your wallet and paying a network fee.

**Example/Use Case:**

*   The video demonstrates opening a 2x leveraged long position on ETH/USD, paying 0.01 ETH, using WETH as collateral, within the WETH-USDC pool. It details the resulting position size, fees, and liquidation price based on these parameters.
