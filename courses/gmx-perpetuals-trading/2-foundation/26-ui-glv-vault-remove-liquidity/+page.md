Okay, here is a very thorough and detailed summary of the video clip provided, covering the steps, concepts, and specific details shown.

**Overall Summary:**

The video demonstrates the process of removing liquidity from a GMX V2 GLV (GMX Liquidity Vault) token pool, specifically the `GLV (BTC-USDC)` vault. The user initiates a sell/withdrawal of their entire GLV token balance, selects a specific underlying GM (GMX Market) pool (`BTC/USD`) to facilitate the withdrawal, approves the GMX contract to spend their GLV tokens (a standard ERC-20 approval step), and finally confirms the transaction to receive the underlying assets (USDC and BTC) back into their wallet.

**Platform Context:**

The interface appears to be the GMX V2 trading/liquidity platform (app.gmx.io). The user is interacting with yield-optimized vaults (GLV) and underlying single-market pools (GM).

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1.  **Navigate to Sell Function:** The user starts on a screen displaying available "GLV Vaults". They locate the `GLV (BTC-USDC)` vault, which shows their wallet holds `7.5790` GLV tokens (worth `$10.05`). They click the "Sell" button for this specific vault.
2.  **Initiate Sell GLV:** A detailed panel/modal appears, specific to the `GLV (BTC-USDC)` vault. The "Sell GLV" tab is active.
3.  **Specify Amount:** In the "Pay" section, the user intends to sell their maximum GLV balance. They click the "MAX" button, which inputs their full balance: `7.579016511064473621` GLV (displayed value `$10.05`).
4.  **View Estimated Received Assets:** The "Receive" sections automatically populate, showing the estimated amounts of the underlying assets they will get back:
    *   Initially (before pool selection change), it shows approximately `4.889` USDC (`$4.88`) and `0.00006119` BTC (`$5.16`). *Note: These values fluctuate slightly in real-time.*
5.  **Select Withdrawal Pool:**
    *   The interface defaults to using the `FARTCOIN/USD [BTC-USDC]` pool for the withdrawal calculation/execution (shown under the "Pool" label).
    *   The user clicks on this pool selection dropdown.
    *   A search bar appears. The user types `BTC`.
    *   They select the `BTC/USD [BTC/USD]` pool from the filtered list.
    *   The estimated "Receive" amounts update slightly after selecting the BTC/USD pool to approximately `4.918` USDC (`$4.91`) and `0.00006085` BTC (`$5.13`).
6.  **Approve Token Spending:**
    *   Since GLV is an ERC-20 token, the user must first grant the GMX smart contract permission to transfer these tokens from their wallet.
    *   The user clicks the checkbox labeled "Allow GLV to be spent".
    *   This action triggers a wallet interaction (likely MetaMask, based on the popup style) requesting a "Spending cap request".
    *   The user clicks "Confirm" within their wallet popup to approve the spending.
7.  **Confirm Sell Transaction:**
    *   After the approval transaction confirms on the blockchain, the button changes from "Pending GLV approval" to "Sell GLV".
    *   The user clicks the "Sell GLV" button.
    *   This triggers another wallet interaction for the main withdrawal transaction ("Transaction request").
    *   The user clicks "Confirm" within their wallet popup again.
8.  **Transaction Processing:** A green notification box appears in the bottom-right corner indicating the progress:
    *   "Selling GLV [BTC-USDC]"
    *   "Sell request sent"
    *   "Fulfilling sell request"
    *   The final estimated receive amounts shown during this confirmation are `4.918158` USDC and `0.00006085` BTC.

**Important Concepts:**

1.  **GLV (GMX Liquidity Vault):** These are yield-optimized vaults containing multiple GM tokens. Users deposit assets (like BTC, ETH, USDC) and receive GLV tokens representing their share. These vaults accrue fees from leverage trading and swaps happening across the markets included in the vault. The `GLV (BTC-USDC)` vault is backed by BTC and USDC liquidity.
2.  **GM (GMX Market) Pools:** These are the underlying liquidity pools for individual markets (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD). GLV vaults are composed of liquidity drawn from or allocated across multiple GM pools.
3.  **Liquidity Removal (Selling GLV):** Selling GLV tokens is the mechanism for withdrawing the underlying liquidity (BTC and USDC in this case) from the vault. The amount of each underlying asset received depends on the current composition and prices within the vault/selected pool at the time of withdrawal.
4.  **ERC-20 Token Approval:** A standard security feature on EVM-compatible blockchains. Before a smart contract can interact with (e.g., transfer) a user's ERC-20 tokens, the user must explicitly approve the contract to spend up to a certain amount (or an unlimited amount) of that token. This was the "Allow GLV to be spent" step.
5.  **Withdrawal Pool Selection:** An interesting feature shown is the ability to select *which* underlying GM pool should be used as the reference or source for executing the withdrawal. Selecting `BTC/USD` instead of the default `FARTCOIN/USD` likely influences the exact exchange rates or slippage experienced during the conversion of the GLV share back into BTC and USDC, based on the state of the chosen pool.
6.  **Transaction Fees:** The UI shows fields for "Fees and Price Impact" and "Network Fee" (`~$0.27` shown for network fee during the process). These are costs associated with interacting with the blockchain and the GMX protocol.

**Notes or Tips:**

*   **Two-Step Process:** Removing liquidity (selling GLV) requires two separate blockchain transactions: first, the ERC-20 approval, and second, the actual sell/withdrawal transaction.
*   **Wallet Interaction:** Users need a compatible web3 wallet (like MetaMask) connected and funded with the native gas token (e.g., ETH on Arbitrum) to pay for transaction fees.
*   **Pool Selection Matters:** The choice of the underlying GM pool for withdrawal can potentially affect the final amounts of assets received due to differences in pool liquidity or pricing at that moment.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The estimated amounts of assets to be received can fluctuate slightly based on real-time market price changes within the GMX system.

**Examples or Use Cases:**

The entire video serves as a direct example and use case of:
*   How to remove liquidity from a GMX V2 GLV vault.
*   How to sell GLV tokens (`GLV (BTC-USDC)`) to get back the underlying assets (BTC and USDC).
*   The process involving ERC-20 approval and transaction confirmation via a wallet.
*   Utilizing the feature to select a specific GM pool (`BTC/USD`) for the withdrawal.
