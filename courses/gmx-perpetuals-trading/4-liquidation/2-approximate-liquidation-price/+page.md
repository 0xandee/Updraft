Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video "Approximate Liquidation Price":

**Overall Summary**

The video explains how to derive simplified, approximate formulas for calculating the liquidation price of leveraged long and short positions on platforms like GMX. It acknowledges that the exact calculation is complex, involving multiple factors like fees and collateral price fluctuations. However, by making certain assumptions (primarily ignoring fees and minimum collateral requirements, and considering specific collateral types), it derives easy-to-use formulas that provide quick estimates. These estimates are shown to be reasonably close to the actual liquidation prices displayed on the GMX platform, particularly when collateral is the index asset itself or at higher leverages when using stablecoin collateral.

**Core Problem Addressed**

Calculating the precise liquidation price involves several variables and calculations (multiplication, addition, subtraction), making it difficult to do quickly mentally or for estimation purposes. The video aims to simplify this by deriving approximate formulas.

**Key Concepts and Their Relationships**

1.  **Liquidation Price:** The price of the underlying asset (index) at which a leveraged position (long or short) is automatically closed by the platform to prevent further losses beyond the posted collateral.
2.  **Liquidation Condition:** The core principle driving liquidation. The video presents it as:
    *   `Liquidation if C_usd + P_usd - f < m`
    *   This means a position is liquidated if the current USD value of the collateral (`C_usd`) plus the current Profit or Loss of the position (`P_usd`), minus any applicable fees (`f`), falls below a minimum required USD value (`m`).
3.  **Collateral Value (`C_usd`):**
    *   Calculated as: `C_usd = C0 * Pc`
    *   `C0`: The amount of collateral tokens deposited.
    *   `Pc`: The current USD price of the collateral token.
    *   `Pc0`: The price of the collateral token *at the time the position was entered*.
    *   `C0 * Pc0`: The initial USD value of the collateral.
4.  **Profit & Loss (`P_usd`):**
    *   Calculated based on the position size in tokens (`S0`), the current index price (`PI`), and the index price at entry (`PI0`).
    *   `S0`: Size of the position in terms of the index asset (e.g., how many ETH the position represents).
    *   `PI`: Current USD price of the index asset (e.g., current ETH/USD price).
    *   `PI0`: USD price of the index asset when the position was entered.
    *   **Long Position:** `P_usd = S0 * (PI - PI0)` (Profit when price goes up)
    *   **Short Position:** `P_usd = S0 * (PI0 - PI)` (Profit when price goes down)
5.  **Fees (`f`):** Includes various fees like opening, closing, and borrowing/funding fees. For approximation, these are often ignored.
6.  **Minimum Collateral (`m`):** A small buffer required by the platform. Also ignored for the approximation.
7.  **Position Size vs. Collateral (Leverage Factor `k`):** A crucial link established to relate the size of the trade to the collateral used.
    *   Position Size in USD (at entry): `S0 * PI0`
    *   Collateral Value in USD (at entry): `C0 * Pc0`
    *   Relationship: `S0 * PI0 = k * C0 * Pc0`
    *   `k` essentially represents the leverage of the position (Position Value / Collateral Value at entry).

**Derivation of Approximate Liquidation Price (Long Position)**

The video derives the approximate liquidation price (`PI`) by simplifying the liquidation condition under specific scenarios, primarily assuming `f = 0` and `m = 0`.

**Scenario 1: Long Position with Stablecoin Collateral**
*   **Assumptions:** `Pc = 1` (collateral price is always $1), `Pc0 = 1`, `f = 0`, `m = 0`.
*   **Starting Inequality:** `C0 * 1 + S0 * (PI - PI0) < 0`
*   **Leverage Relationship:** `S0 * PI0 = k * C0 * 1` => `S0 = k * C0 / PI0`
*   **Substitution & Simplification:**
    *   `C0 + (k * C0 / PI0) * (PI - PI0) < 0`
    *   `C0 + (k * C0 / PI0) * PI - k * C0 < 0`
    *   `(k * C0 / PI0) * PI < C0 * (k - 1)`
    *   `PI < ((k - 1) / k) * PI0`
*   **Approximate Formula:** `Liquidation Price (PI) ≈ ((k - 1) / k) * Entry Price (PI0)`

**Scenario 2: Long Position with Index Asset as Collateral**
*   **Assumptions:** `Pc = PI` (collateral price moves with index price), `Pc0 = PI0`, `f = 0`, `m = 0`.
*   **Starting Inequality:** `C0 * PI + S0 * (PI - PI0) < 0`
*   **Leverage Relationship:** `S0 * PI0 = k * C0 * PI0` => `S0 = k * C0`
*   **Substitution & Simplification:**
    *   `C0 * PI + (k * C0) * (PI - PI0) < 0`
    *   `C0 * PI + k * C0 * PI - k * C0 * PI0 < 0`
    *   `PI * C0 * (1 + k) < k * C0 * PI0`
    *   `PI < (k / (k + 1)) * PI0`
*   **Approximate Formula:** `Liquidation Price (PI) ≈ (k / (k + 1)) * Entry Price (PI0)`

**Approximate Liquidation Price Formulas (Short Position)**

The video states the results for short positions (derived similarly, assuming `f=0, m=0`):

*   **Short Position with Stablecoin Collateral (Pc=1):**
    *   `Liquidation Price (PI) ≈ ((k + 1) / k) * Entry Price (PI0)`
*   **Short Position with Index Asset as Collateral (Pc=PI):**
    *   `Liquidation Price (PI) ≈ (k / (k - 1)) * Entry Price (PI0)`
    *   Note: This implies k > 1 (leverage must be greater than 1x) for a valid liquidation price above zero.

**Important Formulas / "Code Blocks"**

The key formulas derived and discussed are the final approximation formulas:

*   **Long, Stablecoin Collateral:** `PI_liq ≈ ((k - 1) / k) * PI0`
*   **Long, Index Collateral:** `PI_liq ≈ (k / (k + 1)) * PI0`
*   **Short, Stablecoin Collateral:** `PI_liq ≈ ((k + 1) / k) * PI0`
*   **Short, Index Collateral:** `PI_liq ≈ (k / (k - 1)) * PI0`

Where:
*   `PI_liq` is the approximate liquidation price of the index.
*   `k` is the leverage factor (`Position Size / Collateral Value` at entry).
*   `PI0` is the index price at the time the position was entered.

**Examples and Use Cases**

The video uses the GMX interface to demonstrate the formulas:

1.  **Long ETH/USD with USDC Collateral (Stablecoin Case):**
    *   At 1x leverage (k=1), the formula gives `PI < 0`. The actual GMX price is $11.11, showing fees/buffer (`f`, `m`) matter at low leverage.
    *   At 2x leverage (k=2), formula gives `PI < ((2-1)/2)*PI0 = 0.5 * PI0`. With entry `PI0 ≈ $1983`, approx. liq. is `$991.5`. GMX shows `$950.48`. The estimate is in the right ballpark, closer than at 1x.
2.  **Long ETH/USD with WETH Collateral (Index Asset Case):**
    *   At 1x leverage (k=1), formula gives `PI < (1/(1+1))*PI0 = 0.5 * PI0`. With entry `PI0 ≈ $1981`, approx. liq. is `$990.5`. GMX shows `$996.09`. The estimate is very close in this case, even at low leverage.

**Important Notes and Tips**

*   These formulas are *approximations* and work best when fees (`f`) and the minimum collateral buffer (`m`) are small compared to the position/collateral size.
*   The accuracy improves at higher leverage (`k`) because the fixed costs (`f`, `m`) become proportionally smaller.
*   The approximation when using the index asset as collateral (e.g., WETH for ETH long) appears more accurate, especially at lower leverage, compared to using stablecoin collateral. This is likely because the collateral value (`C_usd`) changes with the index price, partially offsetting PnL changes in the liquidation condition.
*   These formulas allow for quick mental estimation of liquidation risk based only on entry price and leverage.
