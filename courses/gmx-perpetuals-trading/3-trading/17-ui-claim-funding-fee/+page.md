## How to Claim Funding Fees on GMX

GMX perpetual swap contracts involve funding fees, which are periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions. Depending on your position and market conditions, you may accrue funding fees that you are entitled to receive. This guide outlines the steps to claim these accrued fees using the GMX user interface.

1.  **Navigate to the Trading Interface:** Start on the main GMX trading page for the relevant market (e.g., ETH/USD). Ensure your web3 wallet (like MetaMask) is connected to the platform. Your connected address should be visible.

2.  **Locate the Claims Section:** Scroll down the trading page, past the price chart and the Long/Short/Swap trading panel. You will find a section with several tabs, typically including "Positions", "Orders", "Trades", and "Claims".

3.  **Access Your Claims:** Click on the "Claims" tab. If you have items ready to be claimed, you might see a number indicator next to the tab label (e.g., "Claims (1)").

4.  **Identify Claimable Funding Fees:** Within the "Claims" section, examine the "Claimable" area. If you have accrued funding fees available, they will be listed here, often showing the specific amount (e.g., "Funding fees +$0.07").

5.  **Initiate the Claim:** An active "Claim" button will be displayed next to the amount of claimable funding fees. Click this "Claim" button.

6.  **Confirm Transaction in Wallet:** Your connected wallet will generate a transaction request prompt. This prompt will show details of the transaction, including:
    *   The small amounts of assets (like WETH and USDC, corresponding to the claimed value) you will receive.
    *   The estimated network fee (gas cost) required to execute the transaction on the blockchain.

7.  **Approve the Transaction:** Carefully review the details in your wallet prompt. If everything looks correct, click the "Confirm" button within your wallet to approve and broadcast the transaction.

8.  **Verify Claim Success:** Once you confirm the transaction in your wallet, the prompt will close. You can verify the claim was successful on the GMX interface:
    *   The "Claimable" funding fee amount under the "Claims" tab should now show "$0.00" or reflect any remaining claimable items.
    *   Check the "Claims History" section, usually located just below the claimable area. A new entry detailing the "Claim Funding Fees" transaction you just completed will appear, showing the date, time, and the amount claimed (e.g., "Claim Funding Fees today at 9:10 AM $0.07"). This history provides a record of all your past claims.

You have now successfully claimed your accrued funding fees on GMX. The claimed assets have been transferred to your connected wallet, less the network transaction fee paid.
