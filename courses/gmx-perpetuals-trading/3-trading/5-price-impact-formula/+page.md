Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video segment (00:00 - 02:18) on Price Impact calculation:

**Overall Purpose:**
The video segment aims to explain the formula used to calculate "Price Impact" within the system. It starts by defining two crucial preliminary concepts, "Same side" and "Cross over," which determine how the price impact is calculated.

**1. Prerequisite Concepts:**

*   **Same Side (0:05 - 0:47):**
    *   **Definition:** This condition occurs when the *direction* of the imbalance (which side, long or short, is larger) remains the same *before* and *after* an action (like a swap or position change).
    *   **Conditions:**
        *   `same side = long < short AND next long < next short`
        *   **OR**
        *   `same side = long >= short AND next long >= next short`
    *   **Context for "long" and "short":**
        *   For **Swaps (0:20):** "long" refers to the USD value of the long tokens, and "short" refers to the USD value of the short tokens.
        *   For **Positions (0:25):** "long" refers to the long open interest, and "short" refers to the short open interest.
    *   **Example 1:** If initially longs are less than shorts, and after the action, the new value of longs is still less than the new value of shorts, it's "Same side".
    *   **Example 2:** If initially longs are greater than or equal to shorts, and after the action, the new value of longs is still greater than or equal to the new value of shorts, it's "Same side".

*   **Cross Over (0:47 - 0:50):**
    *   **Definition:** This is simply the opposite of "Same side." It occurs when the action causes the direction of the imbalance to flip (e.g., longs were smaller than shorts, but become larger after the action, or vice-versa).
    *   **Formula:** `cross over = not same side`

**2. Price Impact Formula (0:51 - 2:11):**

The calculation method for price impact differs based on whether the situation is "Same side" or "Cross over."

*   **Variables Defined (0:54 - 1:00, 1:24, 2:04):**
    *   `d0`: Initial imbalance in USD (before the action).
    *   `d1`: Next imbalance in USD (after the action).
    *   `e`: Exponent factor (used in the power calculation).
    *   `f`: Impact factor (used in the "Same side" calculation). This factor's value depends on whether the imbalance increased or decreased (sign of `d0 - d1`).
    *   `p`: Positive impact factor (used in the "Cross over" calculation).
    *   `n`: Negative impact factor (used in the "Cross over" calculation).

*   **Calculation Logic (1:01 - 1:05):** The calculation method depends on the "Same side" vs. "Cross over" condition.

*   **"Same Side" Price Impact Calculation (1:06 - 1:48):**
    *   **Condition:** Applies when the imbalance remains on the same side (as defined previously).
    *   **Impact Factor (`f`) Determination (1:24 - 1:27):** The specific value of `f` (positive or negative impact factor) depends on whether the *magnitude* of the imbalance increased or decreased.
        *   If `d0 - d1 > 0` (imbalance decreased), a certain `f` is used. (1:07 - 1:12)
        *   If `d0 - d1 < 0` (imbalance increased), a different `f` might be implied, though the formula shown uses a single `f`. (1:13 - 1:18) *Note: The video says `f` depends on positive or negative impact, implying two potential values, but writes the formula with a single `f`.*
    *   **Formula Shown (1:30 - 1:48):**
        ```markdown
        same side price impact = d0 ^ e * f - d1 ^ e * f
        ```
        This formula calculates the difference between the initial imbalance and the next imbalance, each raised to the power of the exponent factor `e` and multiplied by the relevant impact factor `f`.

*   **"Cross Over" Price Impact Calculation (1:49 - 2:11):**
    *   **Condition:** Applies when the imbalance flips sides (not "Same side").
    *   **Impact Factor Determination:** Instead of a single factor `f`, it uses two distinct factors: `p` (positive impact factor) and `n` (negative impact factor). (2:03 - 2:10)
    *   **Formula Shown (1:55 - 2:11):**
        ```markdown
        cross over price impact = d0 ^ e * p - d1 ^ e * n
        ```
        This formula is similar in structure to the "Same side" one, but crucially uses potentially different impact factors (`p` and `n`) for the initial (`d0`) and next (`d1`) imbalance terms. It effectively replaces the first `f` from the same-side formula with `p` and the second `f` with `n`.

**3. Code References (2:11 - 2:14):**

The video mentions that the code implementing these formulas can be found in specific utility functions, highlighting these links/names in the markdown:

*   `SwapPricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsd`
*   `PositionPricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsd`
*   `PricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsdForSameSideRebalance`
*   `PricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsdForCrossoverRebalance`

**4. Notes/Tips:**

*   Understanding "Same side" vs. "Cross over" is fundamental to applying the correct price impact formula.
*   The meaning of "long" and "short" depends on whether you are dealing with swaps (USD value) or positions (open interest).
*   The impact factor `f` in the "Same side" calculation depends on whether the action increased or decreased the magnitude of the imbalance.
*   The "Cross over" calculation uses distinct positive (`p`) and negative (`n`) impact factors.

**5. Omission (2:14 - 2:18):**

The presenter states that the code itself is straightforward and therefore omits a detailed explanation of the code implementation.
