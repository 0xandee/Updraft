Okay, here is a detailed summary of the provided video clip about GMX trading fees.

**Overall Topic:** The video explains the various fees associated with trading (opening/closing long/short positions) and swapping tokens on the GMX decentralized exchange platform, using the GMX user interface as a visual aid.

**Fees for Opening/Closing Positions (Long/Short):**

1.  **Network Fee (Gas Fee):**
    *   **Concept:** This is the standard blockchain transaction fee required to execute the order on the underlying network (e.g., Arbitrum, Avalanche). It must be paid for the order to be processed.
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:06.
    *   **Example:** The interface shows "Network Fee -$0.07" under "Execution Details" for the short position example.

2.  **Open/Close Fee:**
    *   **Concept:** A one-time fee charged by GMX for initiating *or* closing a leveraged position. The video mentions it applies to both actions. It's often a percentage of the position size.
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:11.
    *   **Example:** A pop-up/tooltip (briefly visible when hovering over "Fees" at 0:10) mentions "Open Fee: (0.000% of position size)" – *Note: The 0.000% might be a display quirk or specific to the small position size/current conditions; typically this is a non-zero fee like 0.1%*. The main "Fees" line under Execution Details shows "-$0.01", which likely incorporates this fee.

3.  **Borrowing Fee:**
    *   **Concept:** An ongoing, hourly fee charged for borrowing the asset needed to maintain the leveraged position (e.g., borrowing USDC to short ETH, or borrowing ETH to long ETH). This fee accrues as long as the position remains open.
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:15.
    *   **Example:** The pop-up/tooltip (visible at 0:10) shows "Borrow Fee: <-$0.01".

4.  **Funding Fee:**
    *   **Concept:** An ongoing, hourly fee paid between long and short positions to help keep the GMX market price aligned with the underlying asset's index price. Depending on whether longs or shorts are dominant (and paying the fee), a trader might pay *or receive* this fee.
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:16.
    *   **Example:** The pop-up/tooltip (visible at 0:10) shows "Funding Fee: <-$0.01".

5.  **Price Impact:**
    *   **Concept:** This is not strictly a fee but affects the execution price. It reflects how much a trade shifts the balance of assets in the GMX liquidity pool (GLP). If a trade brings the pool *closer* to its target asset weights, the trader gets a better price (positive price impact/reward). If it pushes the pool *further* from balance, the trader gets a worse price (negative price impact/penalty).
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:18 - 0:24.
    *   **Example:** The interface under "Price Impact / Fees" shows "-0.075% / -0.060%", indicating a negative impact (penalty) for opening this specific short position.

**Fees for Swaps:**

1.  **Network Fee (Gas Fee):**
    *   **Concept:** Same as for positions – the blockchain transaction cost.
    *   **Video Mention:** Mentioned again at 0:38 (initially called "execution fee", then clarified as "Network Fee").
    *   **Example:** The swap interface shows "Network Fee -$0.08".

2.  **Price Impact:**
    *   **Concept:** Similar to positions, this reflects how the swap affects the balance of the GLP pool. A swap improving balance gets a bonus; a swap worsening balance gets a penalty.
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:26.
    *   **Example:** The swap interface shows "Positive Price Impact / Fees +0.018% / -0.050%". It also details "Swap Price Impact: <-$0.01 (0.019% of swap amount)", indicating a small positive impact (bonus/better price) for this ETH to USDC swap.

3.  **Swap Fee:**
    *   **Concept:** A fee charged by GMX specifically for executing a token swap. The video states it's based on the "token in" (the token being sold/swapped from). This fee goes primarily to GLP holders.
    *   **Video Mention:** Discussed at 0:27-0:28.
    *   **Example:** The swap interface shows "Swap ETH to USDC: <-$0.01 (0.050% of swap amount)".

**Hidden Fee:**

1.  **UI Fee:**
    *   **Concept:** A fee charged specifically for using the front-end interface (app.gmx.io in this case). This fee is *not* part of the core GMX protocol smart contracts but is levied by the entity providing the interface.
    *   **Video Mention:** Explicitly mentioned as *not shown* on the screen at 0:30-0:33 and again at 0:42-0:44.

**Common Fees & Complexity:**

*   **Common Fees:** The narrator highlights (0:34-0:41) that the **Execution Fee (Network Fee)** and **Price Impact** are common elements affecting both opening/closing positions and swaps.
*   **Complex Fees:** The video concludes (0:46-0:54) by stating that **Price Impact**, **Borrowing Fee**, and **Funding Fee** require more detailed explanation due to their dynamic nature, and that Price Impact will be covered in the next video.

**Key Concepts & Relations:**

*   **Fees vs. Price Impact:** Fees are direct charges (Network, Open/Close, Borrowing, Funding, Swap, UI). Price Impact is an adjustment to the execution price based on pool balance effects.
*   **One-Time vs. Ongoing Fees:** Open/Close fees are paid once per action. Borrowing and Funding fees accrue hourly while a position is open. Network fees are paid per transaction. Swap fees are paid per swap.
*   **Pool Balance:** Price Impact is directly tied to maintaining the desired balance of assets within the GMX Liquidity Pool (GLP). Trades that help balance are rewarded; trades that hurt balance are penalized.
