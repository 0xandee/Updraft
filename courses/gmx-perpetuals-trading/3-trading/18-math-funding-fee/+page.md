Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video segment on Funding Fees:

**Overall Concept: Funding Fee Calculation**

The video explains how funding fees are calculated for perpetual swap positions, specifically drawing parallels to how borrowing fees were calculated in a previous context (likely related to lending/borrowing mechanics on the same platform). The core mechanism relies on tracking cumulative values over time.

**Core Calculation Method (Simplified View)**

1.  **Similarity to Borrowing Fees:** The fundamental approach is analogous to borrowing fee calculations. It avoids iterating through every historical second for every position update. (0:00-0:06)
2.  **Cumulative Tracking:** The system keeps track of two global, cumulative funding fee values *per unit of position size*:
    *   The *current* global cumulative funding fee per unit size.
    *   The global cumulative funding fee per unit size *at the time the specific position was created or last updated*. (0:07-0:14)
3.  **Fee Calculation:** The funding fee owed or claimable for a specific position is calculated as:
    `Funding Fee = Position Size * (Current Cumulative Fee Per Size - Entry Cumulative Fee Per Size)` (0:14-0:18)

**Market Dynamics and Initial Assumption**

1.  **Two-Way Payments:** Due to market dynamics (differences between perpetual price and index price, and relative sizes of long/short open interest), sometimes longs pay funding fees to shorts, and other times shorts pay longs. (0:19-0:24)
2.  **Simplifying Assumption for Explanation:** To simplify the initial explanation and math derivation, the video assumes a specific scenario: **Long open interest is always the larger side**. This implies that **longs always pay the funding fee to the shorts**. (0:19-0:32)

**Handling Both Long/Short Payment Directions (Robust Method)**

1.  **The Problem:** The simplifying assumption (longs always pay shorts) isn't always true. What if shorts need to pay longs?
2.  **The Solution:** The system can handle this by tracking *two separate* global cumulative funding fee metrics *per unit size*:
    *   One for the **long** side (`F_i` in later notation).
    *   One for the **short** side (`C_i` in later notation). (0:33-0:43)
3.  **Update Logic:**
    *   When longs pay shorts (Funding Rate > 0, Long OI > Short OI, or similar conditions depending on exact protocol): Update the *long* cumulative funding fee per size.
    *   When shorts pay longs (Funding Rate < 0, Short OI > Long OI, etc.): Update the *short* cumulative funding fee per size. (0:44-0:51)
    *   This ensures that the calculation `Position Size * (Current Cumulative Fee - Entry Cumulative Fee)` uses the correct cumulative fee stream corresponding to the position's side (long or short).

**Detailed Derivation and Formulas**

1.  **Visualizing Components Over Time:**
    *   A graph shows the *total funding fee amount* (paid from the larger side to the smaller side, assumed longs to shorts here) changing at discrete time intervals (t0, t1, t2...). (0:52-0:57)
    *   A second graph shows the *total long open interest* (sum of all long position sizes) also changing over time. It also illustrates a specific user's position (size 100) open between time `t2` and `t5`. (0:58-1:06)
2.  **Calculating Funding Fee Per Unit Size at Time `i`:** To apply the cumulative method, we need the fee *per unit* of position size at each time step `i`.
    *   **For Longs (Paying):** Let `F_i` be the funding fee paid per unit of long position size at time `i`.
        `F_i = (Total Funding Fee paid at time i) / (Total Long Open Interest at time i)` (1:07-1:28)
    *   **For Shorts (Claiming/Receiving):** Let `C_i` be the funding fee claimed per unit of short position size at time `i`. *Under the assumption that longs are paying shorts*.
        `C_i = (Total Funding Fee paid at time i) / (Total Short Open Interest at time i)` (1:28-1:48)
3.  **General Funding Fee Calculation (Pre-Simplification):** Before using the cumulative trick, the *actual* fee for a user `u` over a period from time `k` to `N` is the sum of fees accrued each second, considering their potentially changing position size.
    *   **Notation:**
        *   `L_{u,i}`: Long position size of user `u` at time `i`. (2:00-2:07)
        *   `S_{u,i}`: Short position size of user `u` at time `i`. (2:08-2:12)
    *   **Long Funding Fee (Paid by User `u`):**
        `Total Long Fee = Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} (L_{u,i} * F_i)` (2:13-2:28)
        This sums the product of the user's long size and the per-unit long fee for each second in the interval.
    *   **Short Claimable Funding Fee (Received by User `u`):**
        `Total Short Claimable Fee = Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} (S_{u,i} * C_i)` (2:29-2:55)
        This sums the product of the user's short size and the per-unit short claimable fee for each second.

**Simplification Using Cumulative Factors**

1.  **Goal:** Avoid the computationally expensive summation over potentially long time intervals for every user interaction. (2:56-2:58)
2.  **Method Recall:** Similar to borrowing fees, the simplification involves:
    *   Assuming the user's position size remains **constant** during the time interval `k` to `N`.
    *   Using global **cumulative** funding fee factors (per unit size). (3:00-3:11)
3.  **Simplification for Long Positions:**
    *   **Assumption:** User `u` holds a constant long position size `L` from time `k` to `N`. (`L_{u,i} = L` for `k <= i < N`). (3:12-3:16)
    *   **Derivation:**
        *   Start with `Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} (L_{u,i} * F_i)`.
        *   Substitute `L` for `L_{u,i}`: `Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} (L * F_i)`.
        *   Factor out the constant `L`: `L * Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} F_i`.
        *   Express the sum over the interval `[k, N-1]` as a difference of cumulative sums starting from time 0:
            `L * ( Sum_{i=0}^{N-1} F_i - Sum_{i=0}^{k-1} F_i )` (3:19-3:29)
    *   **Result:** `Funding Fee = L * (Cumulative_Fee_Per_Size_at_N-1 - Cumulative_Fee_Per_Size_at_k-1)`
        This is the user's constant long position size multiplied by the change in the global cumulative long funding fee per size between the start (time `k`) and end (time `N`) of the period. (3:30-3:47)
4.  **Simplification for Short Positions:**
    *   **Assumption:** User `u` holds a constant short position size `S` from time `k` to `N`. (`S_{u,i} = S` for `k <= i < N`). (3:48-3:57)
    *   **Derivation:**
        *   Start with `Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} (S_{u,i} * C_i)`.
        *   Substitute `S` for `S_{u,i}`: `Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} (S * C_i)`.
        *   Factor out the constant `S`: `S * Sum_{i=k}^{N-1} C_i`.
        *   Express the sum as a difference of cumulative sums:
            `S * ( Sum_{i=0}^{N-1} C_i - Sum_{i=0}^{k-1} C_i )` (3:58-4:07)
    *   **Result:** `Claimable Fee = S * (Cumulative_Claimable_Fee_Per_Size_at_N-1 - Cumulative_Claimable_Fee_Per_Size_at_k-1)`
        This is the user's constant short position size multiplied by the change in the global cumulative short claimable funding fee per size over the period.

**Relevance to Code Implementation (GMX)**

*   The video explicitly states that these **simplified forms**, derived by assuming constant position size and using the difference of cumulative sums, are the formulas actually implemented **inside the code of GMX** (presumably the platform this explanation pertains to). (4:08-4:15)

**Key Concepts Summary:**

*   **Funding Fee:** Periodic payments between long and short perpetual contract holders to keep the contract price close to the underlying index price.
*   **Cumulative Fee Factor:** A running sum of the funding fee paid (or claimed) per unit of position size over time. This avoids recalculating history.
*   **Calculation Principle:** Fee = Size * Δ(Cumulative Fee Factor) where Δ is the change between position entry/last update and the current time.
*   **Handling Directionality:** Use separate cumulative factors for longs (`F_i`) and shorts (`C_i`) to correctly account for whether longs pay shorts or vice versa.
*   **Simplification:** Assume position size is constant between updates to use the efficient cumulative factor method. This simplification is used in the GMX codebase.

**Important Notes/Tips:**

*   The assumption `long open interest is always the larger side` is made *only* for simplifying the initial explanation flow. The actual implementation needs to handle both payment directions using separate cumulative fees.
*   The method relies on global cumulative variables that are updated periodically (e.g., every second or funding interval). When a user interacts with their position (open, close, modify), their fee is calculated based on the difference between the *current* global cumulative value and the value *recorded when their position was last touched*.
