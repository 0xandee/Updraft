Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video on Borrowing Fees:

**Overall Summary**

The video explains the concept of a "Borrowing Fee" in the context of trading platforms, likely decentralized perpetual exchanges like GMX (which is mentioned later). It details what the fee is, its purpose, how it's calculated naively, why that naive calculation is problematic for smart contracts due to gas costs, and finally, how a mathematical simplification using cumulative sums allows for an efficient calculation suitable for blockchain implementation.

**Core Concepts and Relationships**

1.  **Borrowing Fee:**
    *   **Definition:** A fee paid by a trader who has opened a position (borrowed liquidity/assets implicitly) to the liquidity providers (LPs) who supplied the assets.
    *   **Payment Trigger:** The fee is typically calculated over the duration the position is open but paid out when the trader *closes* the position.
    *   **Accumulation:** The fee accrues continuously over time while the position is open.

2.  **Liquidity Provider (LP):** The entity providing the assets/liquidity that traders use to open positions. They receive the borrowing fees as compensation.

3.  **Trader:** The entity opening a long or short position, effectively borrowing from the liquidity pool. They pay the borrowing fee.

4.  **Borrowing Factor / Rate (R_i):**
    *   **Definition:** The rate at which the borrowing fee accrues *per second* (or per time unit) *per unit of position size*.
    *   **Variability:** This rate is not constant; it changes over time based on market activity (e.g., utilization of the liquidity pool). The video visualizes this as a step graph where the rate `R_i` applies during the time interval from `t=i` to `t=i+1`.

5.  **Position Size (S_u,i or C):** The size or value of the trader's open position. In the naive formula, it's `S_u,i` (size of user `u` at time `i`). In the simplified formula, it assumes a constant position size `C` for the duration considered.

6.  **Relationship:** Borrowing Fee = f(Position Size, Borrowing Rate, Duration). The fee incentivizes LPs to provide liquidity and encourages traders not to hold positions open indefinitely, especially if unprofitable, thus freeing up liquidity.

**Purpose of Borrowing Fee**

*   **Incentivize Liquidity Providers:** Compensates LPs for providing the assets that traders borrow against.
*   **Incentivize Traders:** Encourages traders to close their positions in a reasonable timeframe, preventing capital from being locked up indefinitely and managing risk for the protocol/LPs. Without the fee, a trader could hold a losing position open forever hoping it turns profitable, at no cost. The fee adds a time-cost element.

**Calculation Method 1: Naive Approach**

*   **Idea:** Calculate the fee accrued during each small time interval (e.g., each second) and sum them up over the entire duration the position is open.
*   **Formula:**
    ```
    Borrowing Fee of user u from time k to N = Σ[i=k to N-1] (S_u,i * R_i)
    ```
    Where:
    *   `Σ` denotes summation.
    *   `i` is the time index (e.g., seconds).
    *   `k` is the time the position was opened.
    *   `N` is the time the position was closed.
    *   `S_u,i` is the position size of user `u` at time `i`.
    *   `R_i` is the borrowing factor/rate per second per unit size during the interval `[i, i+1)`.
*   **Problem:** Implementing this directly in a smart contract is inefficient. At every time step `i` where the rate `R_i` might change or needs to be accounted for, the contract would potentially need to loop through *all* open positions of *all users* (`u`) and update their accrued fee (`S_u,i * R_i`). This leads to extremely high gas costs, making it impractical.

**Calculation Method 2: Simplified/Efficient Approach (Used in GMX)**

*   **Key Insight:** This simplification works effectively when the **position size (`C`) remains constant** between opening and closing.
*   **Derivation:**
    1.  Start with the naive sum for a constant position size `C`: `Fee = C*R_k + C*R_{k+1} + ... + C*R_{N-1}`.
    2.  Factor out the constant position size: `Fee = C * (R_k + R_{k+1} + ... + R_{N-1})`.
    3.  Express the sum of rates `(R_k + ... + R_{N-1})` using *cumulative sums* of rates from the beginning (time `t=0`). Let `CumulativeRateSum(t) = Σ[i=0 to t] R_i`.
    4.  Then `(R_k + ... + R_{N-1}) = (R_0 + ... + R_{N-1}) - (R_0 + ... + R_{k-1})`.
    5.  This translates to: `Σ[i=k to N-1] R_i = Σ[i=0 to N-1] R_i - Σ[i=0 to k-1] R_i`.
*   **Simplified Formula:**
    ```
    Borrowing Fee = C * ( Σ[i=0 to N-1] R_i - Σ[i=0 to k-1] R_i )
    ```
    Where:
    *   `C` is the constant position size.
    *   `k` is the time the position was opened.
    *   `N` is the time the position was closed.
    *   `Σ[i=0 to N-1] R_i` is the cumulative sum of borrowing rates up to the closing time (minus one).
    *   `Σ[i=0 to k-1] R_i` is the cumulative sum of borrowing rates up to the opening time (minus one).
*   **Efficiency:**
    *   The contract only needs to maintain *one* global variable: the cumulative sum of borrowing rates (`Σ R_i`). This is updated whenever the rate `R_i` changes.
    *   When a user opens a position at time `k`, the contract records the current global cumulative sum (`Σ[i=0 to k-1] R_i`) for that specific position.
    *   When the user closes the position at time `N`, the contract reads the *current* global cumulative sum (`Σ[i=0 to N-1] R_i`), subtracts the recorded value from the opening time, and multiplies the difference by the constant position size `C`.
    *   This avoids iterating through all users at every time step, significantly reducing gas costs.

**Important Examples or Use Cases**

*   **Alice's Position:**
    *   Position Size `C` = 100.
    *   Opens at time `t=2` (so `k=2`).
    *   Closes at time `t=5` (so `N=5`).
    *   Duration: Time intervals [2,3), [3,4), [4,5). Rates involved: R2, R3, R4.
    *   Naive Calculation: `Fee = 100*R2 + 100*R3 + 100*R4`.
    *   Simplified Calculation: `Fee = 100 * ( (R0+R1+R2+R3+R4) - (R0+R1) )`
        *   `Σ[i=0 to N-1] R_i = Σ[i=0 to 4] R_i` (Cumulative sum at close time t=5).
        *   `Σ[i=0 to k-1] R_i = Σ[i=0 to 1] R_i` (Cumulative sum at open time t=2).

**Important Notes or Tips**

*   The borrowing fee calculation can be confusing initially.
*   The naive calculation method is computationally expensive for smart contracts.
*   The simplified method relies on the concept of cumulative sums and is gas-efficient.
*   The simplification shown explicitly assumes the position size `C` is constant during the period `[k, N)`. If the position size changes, the calculation becomes more complex (likely requiring updates at the time of change).
*   This simplified approach is used by protocols like GMX.
