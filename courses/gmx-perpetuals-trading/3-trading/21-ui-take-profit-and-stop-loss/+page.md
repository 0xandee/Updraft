Okay, here is a detailed and thorough summary of the video segment (0:00 - 2:43) about setting Take Profit and Stop Loss orders on GMX.

**Video Overview:**
The video segment explains and demonstrates how to use the Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) features on the GMX decentralized perpetual exchange platform when opening both Long and Short positions for the ETH/USD market. It contrasts manual position management with GMX's automated TP/SL orders and explains the underlying mechanism, including the concept of "Auto Cancel".

**Core Concepts Explained:**

1.  **Take Profit (TP):** An order type that automatically closes your position when the market price reaches a predefined, favorable level, thus securing profits.
    *   For **Long** positions: TP triggers when the price rises to or above the specified TP price.
    *   For **Short** positions: TP triggers when the price falls to or below the specified TP price.
2.  **Stop Loss (SL):** An order type that automatically closes your position when the market price reaches a predefined, unfavorable level, thus limiting potential losses.
    *   For **Long** positions: SL triggers when the price falls to or below the specified SL price.
    *   For **Short** positions: SL triggers when the price rises to or above the specified SL price.
3.  **Manual vs. Automated Management:** The video first highlights the inefficiency of manually watching the market to close positions at desired profit or loss levels. It then introduces GMX's TP/SL feature as an automated solution (0:14 - 0:28).
4.  **Three-Order Mechanism:** When a user initiates a position (Long or Short) *with* TP and SL parameters set via the GMX interface, the platform actually creates *three* distinct underlying requests or orders (1:12 - 1:25, 2:07 - 2:14):
    *   Order 1: The primary order to *open* the position (e.g., Long ETH or Short ETH).
    *   Order 2: A conditional order to *close* the position if the Take Profit price is reached.
    *   Order 3: A conditional order to *close* the position if the Stop Loss price is reached.
5.  **Auto Cancel:** This is a crucial feature related to the TP/SL orders (2:17 - 2:43).
    *   **Problem:** If a user manually closes their main position *before* either the TP or SL price is hit, the separate TP and SL conditional orders would normally remain active in the system, even though they are no longer relevant.
    *   **Solution:** The Auto Cancel feature ensures that when the main position is closed (either manually, via TP, or via SL), any associated, remaining TP/SL orders are automatically cancelled by the GMX protocol.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   On the GMX User Interface (UI): Auto Cancel is *automatically enabled* by default when setting TP/SL while opening a position.
        *   Via Smart Contract Interaction: If interacting directly with the GMX smart contracts (e.g., programmatically), the user *must explicitly specify* that Auto Cancel should be enabled (set to `true`) for the TP/SL orders.

**Example 1: Setting TP/SL for a Long ETH Position (0:42 - 1:12)**

*   **Scenario:** User wants to open a Long position for 0.01 ETH/USD.
*   **Current Market Price (Approx):** $2050 - $2052 (fluctuating in the video).
*   **User Goal:**
    *   Take Profit when ETH price reaches $2100.
    *   Stop Loss when ETH price reaches $2000.
*   **UI Interaction:**
    *   Select "Long".
    *   Enter the amount to pay (e.g., 0.01 ETH collateral) and desired leverage (1x shown).
    *   In the "Take Profit / Stop Loss" section:
        *   Enter `2100` in the "Take Profit" price input field. The UI shows the estimated PnL (e.g., +$0.49, +2.37%).
        *   Enter `2000` in the "Stop Loss" price input field. The UI shows the estimated PnL (e.g., -$0.50, -2.51%).
*   **Outcome:** Clicking "Long ETH" would submit the transaction to create:
    1.  An order to open the 0.01 ETH Long position.
    2.  A conditional order to close the position if the price hits ≥ $2100.
    3.  A conditional order to close the position if the price hits ≤ $2000.

**Example 2: Setting TP/SL for a Short ETH Position (1:25 - 2:07)**

*   **Scenario:** User wants to open a Short position for ETH/USD (amount implied to be similar, e.g., 0.009994 ETH).
*   **Current Market Price (Approx):** $2049 - $2051.
*   **User Goal (Prices flipped compared to Long):**
    *   Take Profit when ETH price *falls* to $2000 (Profit in a short comes from price decrease).
    *   Stop Loss when ETH price *rises* to $2100 (Loss in a short comes from price increase).
*   **UI Interaction:**
    *   Select "Short".
    *   Enter the amount to pay and desired leverage.
    *   In the "Take Profit / Stop Loss" section:
        *   Enter `2000` in the "Take Profit" price input field. The UI shows estimated PnL (e.g., -$0.43, -1.09% - *Note: The PnL display seems incorrect here in the video for TP; it should likely be positive profit*).
        *   Enter `2100` in the "Stop Loss" price input field. The UI shows estimated PnL (e.g., -$2.43, -5.81%).
*   **Outcome:** Clicking "Short ETH" would submit the transaction to create:
    1.  An order to open the Short position.
    2.  A conditional order to close the position if the price hits ≤ $2000.
    3.  A conditional order to close the position if the price hits ≥ $2100.

**Important Notes/Tips:**

*   The GMX interface allows setting TP/SL based on the target *Price*.
*   The UI provides an estimated Profit and Loss (PnL) impact in both USD and percentage terms when you input the TP/SL prices.
*   Understanding the three-order mechanism is key to grasping how TP/SL works under the hood.
*   The Auto Cancel feature is crucial for clean order management, preventing orphaned TP/SL orders if the main position is closed prematurely. Be aware of its default behaviour on the UI versus the requirement for explicit setting when using smart contracts directly.

**Links/Resources Mentioned:** None.
**Code Blocks Discussed:** None (interactions are via GUI elements).
**Questions/Answers:** None explicitly posed and answered, but the video implicitly answers "How do I set TP/SL on GMX?" and "What happens to my TP/SL if I close my position manually?".
