Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video walkthrough on GMX staking, delegation, and rewards:

**Video Summary: GMX Staking, Delegation, Unstaking & Rewards**

The video provides a step-by-step demonstration of how to interact with the GMX token on the GMX platform's "Earn" page, focusing on staking, managing voting power through delegation, unstaking, and claiming rewards.

**1. GMX Token Introduction**

*   **Purpose:** GMX is primarily a **governance token**. Holders can use it to vote on proposals related to the GMX protocol.
*   **Utility (Staking):** By staking GMX tokens, users can earn a share of the **protocol fees**. The video starts by showing the user is currently earning rewards with 0.33 staked tokens (specifically 0.33 GMX).

**2. Buying GMX (Brief Overview)**

*   The user briefly clicks the "Buy GMX" button.
*   This reveals a dedicated page showing various options to acquire GMX:
    *   **Decentralized Exchanges (Direct):** Uniswap, GMX itself (on Arbitrum).
    *   **DEX Aggregators:** 1inch, Matcha, Paraswap, KyberSwap, OpenOcean, DODO, Slingshot, Firebird, Odos.
    *   **Centralized Services/Exchanges:** Binance, Bybit, Kucoin, Huobi.
    *   **FIAT Gateways:** Banxa, Transak.
    *   **Cross-Network Bridge:** Bungee (for buying using tokens from other networks).
*   The video doesn't execute a purchase but shows the available avenues.

**3. Staking GMX**

*   **Initial State:** The user navigates back to the "Earn" page and shows their current state:
    *   `Wallet`: 0.10000 GMX ($1.47)
    *   `Staked`: 0.33409 GMX ($4.90)
    *   `Voting Power`: 0.33409 GMX DAO
*   **Process:**
    1.  Click the "Stake" button.
    2.  A "Stake GMX" pop-up appears, showing the maximum stakeable amount (0.1000 GMX from the wallet).
    3.  The user clicks "MAX" to input the full wallet amount (0.1 GMX).
    4.  Click the "Stake" button within the pop-up.
    5.  (Presumably confirms the transaction in their connected wallet off-screen).
*   **Result:**
    *   A "Transaction completed!" notification appears.
    *   `Wallet`: 0.0000 GMX ($0.00)
    *   `Staked`: Increases to 0.43409 GMX ($6.37) (0.33409 + 0.1 = 0.43409).
    *   `Voting Power`: Increases to 0.43409 GMX DAO (corresponding to the new staked amount).

**4. Voting Power and Delegation**

*   **Concept:** Staking GMX grants the user "Voting Power" (denominated in GMX DAO), which allows them to vote on governance proposals.
*   **Options:** Users can either vote directly on proposals themselves or **delegate** their voting power to another account (a delegate) to vote on their behalf.
*   **Delegation Process:**
    1.  Click the "Delegate" button on the GMX "Earn" page.
    2.  The user is redirected to the GMX governance portal hosted on **`tally.xyz`**.
    3.  The Tally page shows the user's current Voting Power (`~0.43 GMX_DAO`) and that it is already **Delegated To** another account (`@xdev_10` in this example).
    4.  **Changing Delegation:**
        *   Click "Update delegation".
        *   Choose "Someone else".
        *   Click "Explore all delegates" to see a list of potential delegates on Tally, showing their total delegated voting power and the number of accounts trusting them.
        *   To delegate to a new address, the user would select one from the list and confirm. (The user doesn't change the delegation in the video).
*   **Viewing Proposals:**
    1.  On the Tally website, click the "Proposals" tab.
    2.  This lists past (Executed, Canceled) and current (Active) proposals.
    3.  The user clicks on an "Active" proposal titled "Administration of Protocol Owned Liquidity".
*   **Attempting to Vote After Delegating:**
    1.  On the proposal page on Tally, click "Vote onchain".
    2.  A voting pop-up appears.
    3.  Crucially, it shows the user's available **Voting power: 0**.
    4.  **Reason:** Because the user has delegated *all* their voting power to `@xdev_10`, they no longer have any voting power available to cast a vote directly from their own account. If they hadn't delegated, their ~0.43 GMX DAO voting power would be shown here.

**5. Unstaking GMX**

*   **Process:**
    1.  Return to the GMX "Earn" page.
    2.  Click the "Unstake" button.
    3.  An "Unstake GMX" pop-up appears, showing the maximum unstakeable amount (~0.4341 GMX).
    4.  The user enters `0.2` GMX to unstake.
    5.  A note confirms that unstaking will reduce (burn) voting power.
    6.  Click the "Unstake" button.
    7.  Confirm the transaction in the connected wallet (MetaMask shown briefly).
*   **Result:**
    *   An "Unstake completed!" notification appears.
    *   `Wallet`: Increases to 0.20000 GMX ($2.94).
    *   `Staked`: Decreases to 0.23409 GMX ($3.44) (0.43409 - 0.2 = 0.23409).
    *   `Voting Power`: Decreases to 0.23409 GMX DAO.

**6. Claiming Rewards**

*   **Source of Rewards:** The video explains that the GMX rewards available to claim primarily come from a **Buyback Mechanism**.
    *   The GMX protocol collects fees from platform usage (trading, etc.).
    *   A portion of these collected fees is used to buy GMX tokens from the open market.
    *   These bought-back GMX tokens are then distributed to GMX stakers as rewards.
*   **Claiming Process:**
    1.  On the GMX "Earn" page, locate the "Total Rewards" section. It shows the claimable `GMX` amount (initially `0.0000197X` < $0.01).
    2.  Click the "Claim" button below the rewards section.
    3.  A "Claim Rewards" pop-up appears, summarizing the claimable amount. Click "Claim" again.
    4.  Confirm the transaction in the connected wallet.
*   **Result:**
    *   A "Transaction completed!" notification appears (implied, though the unstake notification is still visible).
    *   The claimable `GMX` amount in the "Total Rewards" section resets to a very small number (close to zero, shown as `0.00000005` < $0.01), indicating the rewards have been claimed and transferred to the user's wallet (though the wallet balance isn't updated immediately in the video frame for this specific action).

**Key Concepts & Relationships:**

*   **GMX Token:** Governance and reward-earning asset.
*   **Staking:** Locking GMX to earn rewards and gain voting power.
*   **Protocol Fees:** Revenue generated by the GMX platform, distributed partly to stakers.
*   **Voting Power (GMX DAO):** Right to vote on proposals, directly proportional to staked GMX.
*   **Delegation:** Assigning your voting power to another address to vote for you. Delegating removes your ability to vote directly.
*   **Tally.xyz:** The platform used by GMX for governance (viewing proposals, voting, delegation management).
*   **Buyback Mechanism:** Process where protocol fees buy GMX from the market to fund staker rewards.
*   **Unstaking:** Withdrawing staked GMX back to the wallet, reducing rewards and voting power.
*   **Claiming:** Collecting accrued GMX rewards earned from staking.

**Important Links/Resources Mentioned:**

*   **`tally.xyz`**: Used for GMX governance, delegation, and proposal voting.

**Important Notes/Tips:**

*   Staking GMX provides both yield (protocol fees) and governance rights (voting power).
*   Delegating voting power is an option if you trust another entity to vote in line with your interests or if you don't want to actively participate in voting.
*   Delegating your voting power means you *cannot* vote directly on proposals yourself unless you undelegate first (or delegate to yourself).
*   GMX rewards for stakers are funded, at least in part, by the protocol buying back its own token using platform fees.

**Examples/Use Cases:**

*   Staking 0.1 GMX increased staked balance and voting power by 0.1.
*   Delegating ~0.43 GMX DAO to `@xdev_10`.
*   Unstaking 0.2 GMX decreased staked balance and voting power by 0.2, returning 0.2 GMX to the wallet.
*   Claiming a small amount (`~0.000019 GMX`) of accrued rewards.
