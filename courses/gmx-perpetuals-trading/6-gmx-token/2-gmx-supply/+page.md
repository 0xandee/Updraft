Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video clip about GMX token supply:

**Overall Summary**

The video examines the total supply and distribution of the GMX token. It uses a dashboard interface and the official GMX documentation to explain the current supply, how it's distributed (staked, not staked, liquidity), the forecasted maximum supply, and how the supply figure shown on the dashboard is calculated. The video also touches upon the implications of staking GMX for reducing inflation and sell pressure. It concludes by demonstrating how to verify the total minted supply using on-chain data and adjusting for token decimals, then relating this back to the dashboard figure by accounting for locked tokens.

**Key Concepts & Relationships**

1.  **GMX Token:** The utility and governance token for GMX V2 markets. It accrues fees generated by the platform.
2.  **Total Supply (Dashboard):** This figure (shown as ~10.03m) represents the *currently circulating or liquid supply* available, not the total *ever minted*. It's calculated based on minted tokens minus locked tokens.
3.  **Total Minted Supply:** The absolute total number of GMX tokens created on the blockchain (~10.58m as calculated from on-chain data).
4.  **Forecasted Max Supply:** The planned upper limit for the total GMX supply (13.25m GMX), though minting beyond this requires governance approval.
5.  **Token Distribution:** How the current supply is allocated. The video highlights:
    *   **Staked GMX:** Tokens locked by users to earn rewards (61% in the video).
    *   **Not Staked GMX:** Tokens held in wallets but not staked (34% in the video).
    *   **GMX in Liquidity:** Tokens provided to liquidity pools (5% in the video).
6.  **Staking Implications:**
    *   **Reduces Circulating Supply:** Locking tokens via staking removes them from active circulation.
    *   **Reduces Inflationary Pressure:** By reducing the available supply, staking helps counteract inflation.
    *   **Reduces Sell Pressure:** Fewer tokens readily available on the market can decrease downward price pressure.
7.  **Token Decimals:** GMX uses 18 decimals. This is crucial for converting the raw `totalSupply` value from the blockchain (a very large integer) into a human-readable number.
8.  **Locked Tokens:** Tokens held in specific contracts (vesting, bonding, treasury) that are subtracted from the total minted supply to arrive at the dashboard's "Total Supply" figure.

**Dashboard Analysis (Timestamp ~0:00 - 0:15)**

*   The dashboard shows key metrics for the GMX token:
    *   **Price:** ~$14.18 (fluctuates slightly)
    *   **Total Supply:** 10.03m
    *   **Total Staked:** ~$87.53m (value fluctuates slightly)
    *   **Market Cap:** ~$142.24m (value fluctuates slightly)
*   A "Distribution" pie chart is shown, and hovering reveals the allocation:
    *   **61% staked**
    *   **34% not staked**
    *   **5% in liquidity**

**Documentation Analysis (Timestamp ~0:33 - 1:06)**

*   **Resource:** GMX Docs (specifically the "GMX Token Supply" page)
*   **Forecasted Max Supply:** The documentation states the forecasted max supply is **13.25 million GMX tokens**.
*   **Max Supply Allocation:** The video highlights the documented breakdown of this 13.25m allocation:
    *   6 million GMX: XVIX and Gambit migration
    *   2 million GMX: Paired with ETH for liquidity on Uniswap
    *   2 million GMX: Reserved for vesting of Escrowed GMX tokens
    *   2 million GMX: For the treasury
    *   1 million GMX: For integration incentives and community developers
    *   250,000 GMX: Distributed to contributors linearly over 2 years
    *   *(Note: The video narrator confirms these add up to 13.25 million)*
*   **Dashboard Supply Calculation:** The documentation explains how the dashboard's "Total Supply" (the 10.03m figure) is calculated:
    *   It's based on the **total minted GMX tokens** *minus* the tokens held in specific **vesting, bonding, and treasury contracts**.
    *   The video shows the documentation listing these contract addresses (for GMX Bonds, GMX Vester, GLP Vester, Affiliate Vester, Treasury on both Arbitrum and Avalanche).

**On-Chain Data & Calculation (Timestamp ~1:06 - 1:28)**

*   **Resource:** A block explorer interface (like Etherscan or Arbiscan, though not explicitly named) is shown reading the GMX token contract.
*   **Raw Total Supply:** The `totalSupply` field (function `0x18160dd0`) shows the raw value: `10585596280516719390000001`.
*   **Adjusting for Decimals:**
    *   **Tool:** Python Shell
    *   **Concept:** GMX has 18 decimals, so the raw value needs division by 10^18 (or 1e18 in scientific notation).
    *   **Code Block:**
        ```python
        >>> 10585596280516719390000001 / 1e18
        10585596.28051672
        ```
    *   **Result:** This calculation reveals the *total minted supply* is approximately **10.58 million GMX**.
*   **Reconciling with Dashboard:** The video explains that if you take the total minted supply (~10.58 million) and subtract the amounts locked in the specific vesting, bonding, and treasury contracts (listed in the docs), you arrive at the ~10.03 million figure displayed as "Total Supply" on the dashboard.

**Notes & Tips**

*   The "Total Supply" shown on many crypto dashboards often represents circulating/liquid supply, not the absolute maximum or total minted supply. It's important to understand how this figure is calculated, often detailed in project documentation.
*   Staking is presented as a mechanism beneficial for token health by reducing available supply and potentially mitigating inflation and sell pressure.
*   Verifying supply figures requires checking official documentation and potentially cross-referencing with on-chain data, remembering to account for token decimals.

**Questions & Answers**

*   **Implicit Question:** What is the total supply of GMX and how is it distributed?
    *   **Answer:** The dashboard shows ~10.03m as the current liquid supply, distributed as 61% staked, 34% not staked, and 5% in liquidity. The total ever minted is ~10.58m, and the forecasted max is 13.25m.
*   **Implicit Question:** How is the "Total Supply" figure on the GMX dashboard calculated?
    *   **Answer:** It's the total minted GMX tokens (~10.58m) minus the tokens locked in specific vesting, bonding, and treasury contracts, as defined in the GMX documentation.

**Examples & Use Cases**

*   **Use Case:** Understanding GMX tokenomics for investment or participation purposes.
*   **Example:** Demonstrating how to use a dashboard, official documentation, and a simple calculation (Python shell) to understand and verify token supply metrics.
*   **Example:** Showing the specific allocation breakdown of the forecasted maximum GMX supply.
