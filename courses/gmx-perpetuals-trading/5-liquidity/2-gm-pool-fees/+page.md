Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video clip based on the visual information and the provided narration text:

**Video Purpose:**
The video explains the different fees associated with depositing (buying GM tokens) and withdrawing (selling GM tokens) liquidity from a GMX V2 GM Pool.

**Context:**
*   **Platform:** GMX V2 Interface
*   **Section:** Trade -> V2 Pools
*   **Specific Pool:** GM: ETH/USD [WETH-USDC] (GMX Market Tokens)
    *   **Composition:** The pool is composed of approximately 49.40% Long WETH (14.712k) and 50.60% Short USDC (29.929m).
    *   **Function:** This token automatically accrues fees from leverage trading and swaps for the ETH/USD market. It provides exposure to both WETH and USDC according to the displayed composition.
*   **User Action:** The user is exploring the interface to understand the costs of adding and removing liquidity.

**Depositing Liquidity (Buying GM Tokens):**

1.  **Action:** The user is on the "Buy GM" tab, simulating a deposit into the GM: ETH/USD pool.
2.  **Example Transaction:**
    *   **Paying:** 0.01 ETH ($19.86) and 20.343572 USDC ($20.34). Total deposit value: $40.20.
    *   **Receiving:** 28.596... GM: ETH/USD tokens (Estimated value: $40.18 initially, then $40.15, $40.14 as fees are detailed).
3.  **Fees Identified for Depositing:**
    *   **Price Impact:** This fee reflects how much the user's trade affects the pool's price. In the example, it's initially shown as less than -$0.01 (representing 0.001% of the buy amount). The total "Fees and Price Impact" is -$0.03.
    *   **Buy Fee (One-time Deposit Fee):** A specific fee charged for buying GM tokens (depositing liquidity). In the example, this is -$0.03, calculated as 0.070% of the buy amount.
    *   **Network Fee (Execution Fee):** This is the standard blockchain transaction fee (gas fee) required to execute the deposit on the network (e.g., Arbitrum). It is *not* specific to GMX itself. The tooltip clarifies: "Maximum network fee paid to the network. This fee is a blockchain cost not specific to GMX, and it does not impact your collateral." In the example, this is estimated at -$0.05.
    *   **UI Fee:** The narration mentions a UI fee is also applicable when using the GMX user interface (though it's not explicitly broken out in this specific fee display section of the UI).

**Withdrawing Liquidity (Selling GM Tokens):**

1.  **Action:** The user switches to the "Sell GM" tab, simulating a withdrawal from the pool.
2.  **Example Transaction:**
    *   **Paying:** 28.63... GM: ETH/USD tokens ($40.20).
    *   **Receiving:** 20.343573 USDC ($20.34) and 0.01 ETH ($19.83). Total received value before fees: $40.17.
3.  **Fees Identified for Withdrawing:**
    *   **Sell Fee (One-time Withdrawal Fee):** A specific fee charged for selling GM tokens (withdrawing liquidity). In the example, this is -$0.03, calculated as 0.070% of the sell amount.
    *   **Network Fee (Execution Fee):** Similar to depositing, this is the blockchain transaction fee required to execute the withdrawal. The tooltip has the same explanation as above. In the example, this is estimated at -$0.05.
    *   **Price Impact:** Notably, when hovering over the fees during withdrawal, a separate "Price Impact" line item is *not* shown, unlike the deposit section. The narration explicitly points out there seems to be no price impact fee listed for withdrawal, only the one-time sell fee and the network fee. The total "Fees and Price Impact" shown is -$0.03, which corresponds exactly to the Sell Fee in this example.
    *   **UI Fee:** As mentioned for deposits, a UI fee likely applies when using the interface for withdrawals as well.

**Key Concepts Discussed:**

*   **GM Tokens:** Represent shares in a specific GMX V2 liquidity pool, accruing fees from trading activity within that market.
*   **Liquidity Provision Fees:** The costs incurred by users when adding (buying GM) or removing (selling GM) liquidity.
*   **Price Impact:** The effect a user's trade size has on the execution price compared to the current market price, usually higher for larger trades relative to pool depth. This was shown as a component for *depositing*.
*   **Buy/Sell Fees:** Fixed percentage fees charged by GMX for the service of minting (buying) or redeeming (selling) GM tokens. In the example, this was 0.070%.
*   **Network Fee:** The cost paid to the underlying blockchain network validators/miners to process the transaction. This is external to GMX fees.

**Important Questions & Answers:**

*   **Q:** What are the fees for depositing liquidity into a GMX V2 GM pool?
*   **A:** Price Impact, a one-time Buy Fee (e.g., 0.070%), the Network Fee (blockchain gas), and potentially a UI Fee.
*   **Q:** What are the fees for withdrawing liquidity from a GMX V2 GM pool?
*   **A:** A one-time Sell Fee (e.g., 0.070%), the Network Fee (blockchain gas), and potentially a UI Fee. Price impact was *not* explicitly listed as a separate fee component in the withdrawal example shown.

**Summary of Fees:**
Depositing involves Price Impact + Buy Fee + Network Fee (+ UI Fee).
Withdrawing involves Sell Fee + Network Fee (+ UI Fee). (Based on the visual, Price Impact seems negligible or zero for this specific withdrawal example).
