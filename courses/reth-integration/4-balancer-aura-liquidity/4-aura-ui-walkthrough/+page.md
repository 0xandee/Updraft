## Aura UI Walkthrough

Let us take a look at how to provide liquidity to a Balancer through the Aura Finance user interface. To provide liquidity, we will provide it to rETH and wETH.

1.  Search for the rETH and wETH pool by typing `rETH`.
2.  Scroll down, you will see rETH wETH.
3.  From this page, you can stake your rETH wETH BPT token, or single side add liquidity with rETH or wETH.
4.  Click deposit and stake. We have already done this part.
5.  Now we need to claim our rewards. This can be done by clicking on the Claim tab.
6.  Since we have already added liquidity to the rETH wETH pool using Aura Finance, we should see a reward under the Claimable Rewards, under rETH stable pool.
7.  To claim, click on all the rewards, and then click Claim Rewards to claim the rewards.
8.  We can claim for BAL, AURA, and RPL.
