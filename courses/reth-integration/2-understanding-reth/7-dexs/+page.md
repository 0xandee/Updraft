# Obtaining rETH

Here are some of the options to obtain rETH, given that you have ETH, or to redeem ETH, given that you have rETH:
- Directly use the Rocket Pool protocol
- Use a DEX aggregator
- Use any other decentralized exchanges

Let's compare these options.

If we were to directly mint rETH from the Rocket Pool protocol, one ETH will get us roughly 0.88850 rETH. Let's compare this number with DEX aggregators and decentralized exchanges.

On a DEX aggregator like DeFi Llama Swap, one ETH will get us approximately 0.89 rETH.

Let's see what exchange rate Uniswap V3 will give us. Let's say that we want to swap one ETH; it says that we will get roughly 0.89 rETH.

And then on Curve, we can put in one wETH, and it will get us 0.89124 rETH.

How about on Balancer V2? We can put in one wETH, and it will give us 0.89038 rETH.

So currently, the best deal to get rETH from wETH is on Curve. If you want the best deal for your rETH, you'll have to do something similar: compare the exchange rates between different protocols. Here we compared the exchange rates between the Rocket Pool protocol, DEX aggregator, and some decentralized exchanges.

This method goes both ways to exchange ETH to rETH, and if you were to exchange from rETH back to ETH.
