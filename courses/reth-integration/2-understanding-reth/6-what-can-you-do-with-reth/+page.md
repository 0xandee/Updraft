## Performing Operations With rETH
Once we have rETH, we can add liquidity to decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap v3, Curve, and Balancer v2. We can also lend our rETH to Aave or create a leveraged position by supplying rETH as collateral to Aave, then borrowing a stablecoin to buy more rETH. We can also restake rETH on EigenLayer.

Let's take a quick look at the examples that were just mentioned.

First, we can add rETH as liquidity to a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap v3. Inside the web browser, we have the Uniswap v3 app open, and have navigated to the pool for rETH/ETH. To add liquidity to Uniswap v3, click on "Add liquidity", and then we will select the pair rETH and ETH. Select a custom price range, and make sure that the price range is outside of the current price. Then, scroll down, click on continue and specify the amount of rETH to deposit as liquidity. For example, put 0.01 rETH and then click on review to proceed with the transaction. 

It is important to know, however, that we would not recommend putting rETH as liquidity into Uniswap v3. The reason is the value of rETH generally increases over time relative to the value of ETH. This is because rETH accrues the staking rewards. So if we were to add liquidity to Uniswap v3, then we are saying that we are willing to sell our rETH at a certain price range. But over time, rETH will grow in value. So to keep up with this increasing value of rETH, we will have to keep on repositioning the liquidity position in Uniswap v3. Otherwise, we are selling our rETH at a discount.

So if we want to provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange with our rETH, then we suggest we deposit our rETH into other decentralized exchanges such as Curve and Balancer. 

If we wanted to deposit rETH into Curve Finance, then we can head over to the Curve website and search for rETH. Click on the desired pool, then head over to deposit, and here we will be able to specify the amount of wETH and rETH to provide as liquidity. Again we can add 0.01 rETH, click on "Approve Spending" and then submit the transaction to deposit rETH as liquidity. Curve is better than Uniswap for adding rETH because both on Curve and Balancer, the exchange rate of rETH is always updated. 

If we wanted to add liquidity to Balancer v2, head over to pools, then find the rETH wETH pool, and then click on add liquidity. Specify some amount, let's say 0.01 rETH again. And if the wallet is not connected, go ahead and click "Connect wallet", and then proceed with the transaction.

Other than providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange, we can also provide rETH either as collateral or just supply it to a lending market. For example, Aave v3. If we simply want to supply it to a lending market and then earn some interest, we can click on supply. Put your amount in here and proceed with the transaction. Supplying rETH will enable collateralization, and give us borrowing power to borrow some stablecoins. Then if we borrow stablecoin, buy rETH, that is your leveraged position.

For the final example, we can also restake your rETH into EigenLayer. Restake, in simple terms, means we are staking tokens to earn more rewards.  

When we stake ETH into the Rocket Pool, we get back rETH, which is giving us some staking rewards in ETH. Now take this rETH, and then stake it into EigenLayer. By doing so, we'll earn other rewards. Click on "Restake". Click on the token that you want to restake, and specify some amount, then click submit to proceed with the transaction.
