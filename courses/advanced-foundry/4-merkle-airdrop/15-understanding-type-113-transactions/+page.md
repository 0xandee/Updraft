**Account abstraction** is a concept that allows users' assets to be stored in smart contracts rather than externally owned accounts (EOAs).This feature is buil directly in the ZK Sync, and it's said that it has _native_ account abstraction.

On Ethereum, there are two types of accounts:

1. **externally owned accounts (EOAs)**, which require a public and private key pair and users have to sign/initiate their own transactions
2. **contract accounts** are smart contracts that behave as accounts but are also capable of implementing more complex logic. They enable features such as _multiple signers_ or allowing others to pay for gas and send transactions on our behalf.

> 🗒️ **NOTE** <br>
> Smart contract accounts on ZK Sync are automatically a smart contract account. They are fully customizable and include different signature schemes, multi-signature capabilities, and setting spending limits.
