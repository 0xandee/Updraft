        *   *Note:* Requires deployment on a test network (Goerli is suggested in the popup).
    *   **Solodit:**
        *   *Link:* `solodit.xyz` (shown on screen)
        *   *Purpose:* An "amazing tool" specifically for aspiring *auditors*. It aggregates and allows searching through audit reports from top smart contract security professionals.
    *   **Cyfrin:**
        *   *Link:* `cyfrin.io` (shown on screen)
        *   *Purpose:* The speaker's company, offering world-class smart contract auditing and Web3 education.
        *   *Call to Action:* If you are building a protocol, consider Cyfrin for your audit needs.
    *   **Web3 Education:**
        *   *Link:* `web3education.dev` (shown on screen)
        *   *Purpose:* An upcoming education platform.
        *   *Call to Action:* The speaker *strongly urges* absolutely *everyone* to subscribe with their email.
        *   *Reason:* "Amazing surprises" and "awesome opportunities" are coming in the next couple of months for participation, learning, and growth in top security. Don't miss out.

*   **Important Concepts & Notes:**
    *   The resources provided are just the "tip of the iceberg" for security.
    *   More security-focused education is being developed (by Cyfrin/Web3 Education).
    *   **Prerequisite:** The foundational course the viewer just completed *is* the prerequisite for the upcoming security courses. Completing it is the "first step" towards becoming a "smart contract security badass."

**Part 2: Overall Course Conclusion & Next Steps (2:03 - 4:41)**

This part shifts to congratulating the viewer on finishing the entire course and providing guidance on what to do next.

*   **Course Completion:** Screens display "Completed Security" and "Course Completed!!!" with celebratory graphics and QR codes.
*   **Congratulations:** The speaker appears, expressing sincere congratulations for completing the "absolutely monstrosity of a tutorial." He emphasizes what an "amazing job" the viewer has done.
*   **Community Welcome:** He expresses genuine excitement, on behalf of himself and the Web3 community, to have the viewer in the Web3, smart contract, blockchain, and cryptocurrency space.
*   **The "What Now?" Question:** Acknowledges that many viewers wonder where to go after finishing the course.
*   **Core Advice: APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE:**
    *   This is stressed as the *biggest* and *most important* next step.
    *   **Concept:** True, deep learning (described as "10x" the learning from the course) happens when you take the theoretical knowledge and *apply* it by building things and facing challenges *without* direct hand-holding (like in a tutorial).
    *   **Concept:** While the course is thorough, going from tutorial to tutorial isn't as effective as diving in and building/contributing. You *have* to make the leap.
*   **Specific Examples of Applying Knowledge (Next Steps):**
    *   Join a hackathon.
    *   Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub (start by tackling issues).
    *   Apply for grants to fund your ideas.
    *   Apply for jobs (use the course completion and your GitHub repo as proof of skills).
    *   Work on a personal project.
    *   Contribute to someone else's project.
*   **Resources for Next Steps:** Links are available in the course's GitHub repository.
*   **Final Encouragement & Thanks:**
    *   The speaker reiterates he's walked the viewer deep down the "rabbit hole," and now it's up to *them* to use the knowledge.
    *   He thanks everyone who helped create the course.
    *   He thanks the *viewer* for taking the course.
    *   He expresses excitement to see the viewer in the community and, crucially, to see *what they build*.
*   **Concluding Message:** A final screen encourages viewers to check out other courses and emphasizes the mantra: "**And always be learning!!**"

**Summary of Key Takeaways:**

1.  **Security is Vital:** Smart contract security is crucial, and numerous resources exist to learn more.
2.  **Foundation is Built:** This course provides the necessary foundation for further learning, especially in security.
3.  **Application is Key:** The most critical next step after completing the course is to *apply* the learned concepts by building projects, contributing to open source, participating in hackathons, or seeking grants/jobs.
4.  **Real Learning Through Doing:** Facing challenges and solving problems independently during application leads to significantly deeper understanding than passively following tutorials.
5.  **Community & Future:** The Web3 community welcomes new developers, and the speaker is excited about the potential contributions of those who completed the course.
6.  **Continuous Learning:** The journey doesn't end here; always strive to learn more.
