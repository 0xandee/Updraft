Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video about Ethereum and zkSync transaction types:

**Overall Summary**

The video provides a comprehensive explanation of various transaction types used in Ethereum and zkSync. It starts by showing examples of where users might encounter these types (like in Remix, Foundry, or block explorers) and then systematically breaks down each type. It covers the four transaction types shared between Ethereum and zkSync (Types 0, 1, 2, 3) and the two additional types specific to zkSync (Types 113/0x71 and 255/0xff). For each type, the video explains its origin (often an Ethereum Improvement Proposal - EIP), its purpose, key features, and relevant parameters or fields. It highlights the differences in how some types are handled on zkSync compared to Ethereum L1.

**Context and Motivation**

*   Users might notice a `TxType` field when interacting with wallets or tools like Remix, especially when deploying contracts on zkSync (example shown: `TxType: 113`).
*   When using tools like Foundry zkSync, flags like `--legacy` might be used, which relates to a specific transaction type.
*   Block explorers (like Etherscan or zkSync's block scanners) display the transaction type, such as `Txn Type: 2 (EIP-1559)`.
*   The goal of the video is to demystify these types and explain what they mean.

**Shared Ethereum & zkSync Transaction Types (4 Types)**

1.  **Transaction Type 0 (0x0): Legacy Transactions**
    *   **Origin:** This was the original Ethereum transaction format *before* the concept of transaction types was formally introduced.
    *   **Context:** Referenced when the `--legacy` flag was used with Foundry zkSync.
    *   **Purpose:** The foundational transaction structure.
    *   **Key Fields:** Includes standard fields like `nonce`, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `to`, `value`, `data`, `v`, `r`, `s`.
    *   **Note:** It uses the `gasPrice` parameter for setting transaction fees.

2.  **Transaction Type 1 (0x01): Optional Access Lists (EIP-2930)**
    *   **Origin:** Introduced by EIP-2930 to mitigate potential contract breakage risks arising from gas cost changes in EIP-2929.
    *   **Purpose:** To allow transactions to specify an `accessList` of addresses and storage keys they intend to access.
    *   **Key Fields:** Contains all fields from Type 0 (Legacy) *plus* an `accessList` parameter.
    *   **Benefit/Use Case:** Pre-declaring accessed accounts and storage slots in the `accessList` can lead to gas savings, especially for complex transactions involving multiple contract calls.

3.  **Transaction Type 2 (0x02): EIP-1559 Transactions**
    *   **Origin:** Introduced by EIP-1559 during Ethereum's "London" hard fork.
    *   **Context:** Seen on block explorers as `Txn Type: 2 (EIP-1559)`.
    *   **Purpose:** To make gas fees more predictable and less volatile, tackle congestion, and introduce fee burning.
    *   **Key Changes/Fields:**
        *   Replaced `gasPrice` with two new fields:
            *   `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: The maximum "tip" the sender is willing to pay miners/validators to incentivize inclusion.
            *   `maxFeePerGas`: The absolute maximum total fee (base fee + priority fee) the sender is willing to pay per gas unit.
        *   Introduced a `baseFee` which is algorithmically determined per block and is burned.
    *   **zkSync Specific Note:** zkSync *supports* receiving Type 2 transactions for compatibility, but it currently *does not* utilize the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` or `maxFeePerGas` fields in the same way as L1, because its gas mechanism differs. The functionality related to these specific fee parameters is effectively ignored on zkSync.

4.  **Transaction Type 3 (0x03): Blob Transactions (EIP-4844 / Proto-Danksharding)**
    *   **Origin:** Introduced by EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) during Ethereum's "Dencun" hard fork.
    *   **Purpose:** To significantly reduce the cost of data availability for Layer 2 rollups by introducing a separate mechanism ("blobs") and fee market for posting L2 data to L1.
    *   **Key Fields (Additional to Type 2):**
        *   `max_blob_fee_per_gas`: The maximum fee the sender is willing to pay per unit of *blob gas* (a separate fee market from execution gas).
        *   `blob_versioned_hashes`: A list of hashes (commitments) pointing to the actual blob data, which is carried separately from the transaction itself in the network layer.
    *   **Important Note on Blob Fees:** The fee paid for blob gas (`max_blob_fee_per_gas` * blob gas used) is deducted and *burned* from the sender's account *before* the transaction executes. This fee is **non-refundable**, even if the main transaction execution fails.
    *   **Future Content:** The video mentions that Patrick will cover EIP-4844 and blobs in more detail in a subsequent video.

**zkSync Specific Transaction Types (2 Types)**

These types are unique to zkSync and enable its specific features.

1.  **Transaction Type 113 (0x71): EIP-712 Based Transactions**
    *   **Origin:** Based on EIP-712 (Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing).
    *   **Context:** This was the type (`TxType: 113`) shown in the Remix deployment example. Hex representation is `0x71`.
    *   **Purpose:** This is the primary transaction type used on zkSync to interact with its advanced features. It enables:
        *   Native Account Abstraction (allowing smart contracts to be accounts).
        *   Paymasters (allowing third parties or contracts to sponsor transaction fees).
    *   **Requirement:** Deploying smart contracts on zkSync *must* be done using a Type 113 transaction.
    *   **Key Fields (Additional/Modified):** Includes standard Ethereum fields plus zkSync specific ones:
        *   `gasPerPubdata`: Maximum gas the sender will pay per byte of "pubdata" (L2 state data published to L1).
        *   `customSignature`: Allows non-EOA accounts (like smart contract wallets) to provide signatures according to their custom logic.
        *   `paymasterParams`: Contains parameters needed if a paymaster is used (e.g., paymaster address, input data for the paymaster).
        *   `factory_deps`: An array containing the bytecode of contracts to be deployed by this transaction (relevant for contract deployments).

2.  **Transaction Type 255 (0xff): Priority Transactions (L1 -> L2 Communication)**
    *   **Origin:** Internal mechanism within zkSync. Hex representation is `0xff`.
    *   **Purpose:** Represents transactions initiated on Layer 1 (Ethereum) that are intended to be executed on Layer 2 (zkSync). This is how bridging and L1-to-L2 messages are processed via the priority queue.
    *   **Use Case:** Depositing funds from L1 to zkSync, calling an L2 contract from an L1 contract.

**Key Concepts & Relationships**

*   **EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals):** Standards proposals that define new features or changes for Ethereum, many of which introduce new transaction types (EIP-1559, EIP-2930, EIP-4844, EIP-712).
*   **Hard Forks (e.g., London, Dencun):** Network upgrades on Ethereum where new EIPs (and thus sometimes new transaction types) are activated.
*   **Gas Fees:** Transaction types evolved significantly to improve the gas fee mechanism (Legacy `gasPrice` -> EIP-1559 `baseFee` + `priorityFee` -> EIP-4844 separate `blobFee`).
*   **Rollups:** Layer 2 scaling solutions that bundle transactions and post data to L1. EIP-4844 (Type 3) is specifically designed to lower data posting costs for them.
*   **Account Abstraction (AA):** A key feature of zkSync allowing accounts to be smart contracts, enabling custom validation logic, social recovery, etc. Enabled primarily via Type 113.
*   **Paymasters:** zkSync feature allowing transaction fee sponsorship. Enabled via Type 113 (`paymasterParams`).
*   **Pubdata:** Data from L2 (zkSync) that needs to be published to L1 (Ethereum) for security/state reconstruction. Type 113 includes a parameter (`gasPerPubdata`) related to its cost.
*   **L1 -> L2 Transactions:** Communication from the base layer (Ethereum) to the rollup (zkSync), handled by Type 255 (Priority Transactions).
*   **Typed Structured Data (EIP-712):** A standard for hashing and signing structured data (not just arbitrary byte strings), making signing requests more human-readable and secure. Forms the basis for zkSync's Type 113.

**Code Blocks / Examples Mentioned**

*   `TxType: 113`: Seen in the signature request popup when deploying via Remix to zkSync.
*   `forge create ... --legacy --zksync`: Command snippet showing the use of the `--legacy` flag with Foundry zkSync, indicating a Type 0 transaction is being requested.
*   `Txn Type: 2 (EIP-1559)`: Text seen on block explorers for Type 2 transactions.

**Links & Resources Mentioned**

*   Remix IDE (Used for deployment example)
*   Foundry zkSync (Toolchain used for deployment example)
*   Etherscan (Ethereum L1 block explorer)
*   zkSync Blockscanners (zkSync L2 block explorers)
*   Mention of an upcoming video by Patrick Collins explaining EIP-4844/Blobs in detail.

**Important Notes & Tips**

*   zkSync shares Types 0, 1, 2, 3 with Ethereum but adds Types 113 and 255.
*   Deploying contracts on zkSync requires using Type 113 (0x71).
*   zkSync supports Type 2 (EIP-1559) transactions but handles the fee parameters differently due to its own gas model.
*   Blob fees (Type 3) are non-refundable on failure.
*   Type 113 is crucial for accessing zkSync's unique features like native AA and Paymasters.
*   Type 255 is specifically for messages/transactions originating from L1 targeted at L2.

**Questions & Answers (Implicit)**

*   **Q:** What does `TxType: 113` mean when I deploy on zkSync with Remix?
    *   **A:** It refers to zkSync's EIP-712 based transaction (Type 113 / 0x71), necessary for deploying contracts and using features like AA/Paymasters.
*   **Q:** What does the `--legacy` flag do in Foundry zkSync?
    *   **A:** It forces the use of the older Type 0 (Legacy) transaction format.
*   **Q:** What is `Txn Type: 2 (EIP-1559)` on Etherscan?
    *   **A:** It indicates a transaction using the EIP-1559 format with `baseFee` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`/`maxFeePerGas` parameters.
*   **Q:** Why are there different transaction types?
    *   **A:** To introduce new features, improve efficiency (like gas costs), enhance security, and enable specific functionalities (like L2 scaling or L1->L2 communication).
