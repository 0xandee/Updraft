Okay, here is a thorough and detailed summary of the video segment (0:00 to 2:12) on Transaction Types:

**Overall Summary**

The video segment introduces the concept of different transaction types, specifically focusing on a unique type encountered when deploying a smart contract to zkSync using the Remix IDE plugin. It recaps foundational concepts like digital signatures (EIP-712, EIP-191, ECDSA) and Merkle Trees, stating that understanding these is necessary to grasp the upcoming topic. The core of the segment demonstrates deploying a simple `SimpleStorage` contract to zkSync via the Remix zkSync plugin. Instead of a standard transaction confirmation, the process triggers a "Signature Request" in MetaMask, identified as `TxType: 113`. The speaker highlights that this involves signing a structured message (similar to EIP-712) rather than sending a traditional transaction for deployment. The segment concludes by setting the stage for a deeper dive into Ethereum and zkSync transaction types to explain how and why this Type 113 transaction works.

**Key Concepts and Their Relationships**

1.  **Recapped Foundational Concepts:**
    *   **Signatures:** The general mechanism for proving ownership and intent.
    *   **EIP-712:** A standard for hashing and signing *typed structured data* rather than just opaque byte strings. This makes signatures more human-readable and secure in wallets like MetaMask.
    *   **EIP-191:** A related standard specifying how to format messages before signing to avoid collisions with actual transaction data.
    *   **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):** The cryptographic algorithm used by Ethereum (and zkSync) to generate and verify signatures using private/public key pairs.
    *   **Merkle Trees:** Data structures used for efficiently verifying data integrity (mentioned as previously learned, likely relevant to underlying zkSync mechanisms, though not directly applied in *this* specific demonstration).
    *   **Relationship:** The speaker explicitly states that understanding these prior concepts (especially EIP-712 and signatures) is crucial for understanding the transaction type mechanism being introduced. The signature request observed later clearly uses structured data, hinting at an EIP-712-like approach.

2.  **Introduced Concept: Transaction Types**
    *   The core new idea is that not all "actions" on a blockchain are the same type of transaction.
    *   **zkSync Transaction Type 113:** This specific type is highlighted as being used during the contract deployment process via the zkSync Remix plugin.
    *   **Key Characteristic of Type 113 (as observed):** It involves the user *signing a message* (a structured data payload) rather than broadcasting a standard Ethereum-like deployment transaction directly from the wallet.

**Demonstration: Deploying `SimpleStorage` on zkSync via Remix**

1.  **Setup:**
    *   **Tool:** Remix IDE.
    *   **Plugin:** zkSync Remix Plugin (selected in the sidebar).
    *   **Contract:** `SimpleStorage.sol` (a basic contract, shown on screen, previously used in a "Solidity 101" context).
    *   **Compiler:** The zkSync plugin uses its specific compiler (`zksolc`). The speaker clicks "Compile SimpleStorage.sol".
    *   **Environment:** In the "Deploy" tab (within the zkSync plugin section), the environment is set to "Wallet".
    *   **Wallet Connection:** MetaMask wallet is connected to Remix.

2.  **Deployment Action:**
    *   The "Deploy" button is clicked for the compiled `SimpleStorage` contract.

3.  **Crucial Observation (MetaMask Interaction):**
    *   Instead of a typical "Confirm Transaction" pop-up, MetaMask displays a "Signature request".
    *   The request explicitly asks the user to "sign this message".
    *   **Key Field:** `TxType: 113` is clearly visible within the structured data presented for signing.
    *   **Structured Data:** The pop-up shows various fields related to the deployment, broken down nicely (implying EIP-712 formatting):
        *   `From:` (User's address)
        *   `To:` (An address, potentially a factory or system address like `32774`)
        *   `GasLimit:`
        *   `GasPerPubdataByteLimit:` (Specific to zkSync's data handling)
        *   `MaxFeePerGas:`
        *   `MaxPriorityFeePerGas:`
        *   `Paymaster:` (Set to 0 in this case)
        *   `Nonce:`
        *   `Value:` (Set to 0)
        *   `Data:` (The contract creation bytecode + constructor args, a long hex string)
        *   `FactoryDeps:` (Dependencies like the contract bytecode itself, another long hex string)
        *   `PaymasterInput:` (Set to `0x` in this case)

4.  **Outcome:**
    *   The user clicks "Sign" in MetaMask.
    *   The Remix terminal outputs the details of the signed message/transaction object, again showing `"type": 113` and all the fields that were presented in the signature request.
    *   The contract deployment proceeds based on this signature.

**Important Code Blocks / Data Structures Discussed**

*   **`SimpleStorage.sol`:** Although the full code isn't analyzed line-by-line, it's shown briefly and serves as the contract being deployed. Its structure isn't the focus, only its use in the deployment example.
    ```solidity
    // (Shown briefly on screen - typical SimpleStorage structure)
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.19; // Or similar version

    contract SimpleStorage {
        uint256 myFavoriteNumber;
        // ... (struct Person, arrays, mappings, functions like store, retrieve, addPerson)
    }
    ```
*   **Type 113 Transaction Structure (as displayed in Remix/MetaMask):** This isn't code but a data structure whose fields are discussed.
    ```json
    // Conceptual representation based on video
    {
      "type": 113,
      "from": "0xYourAddress...",
      "to": "0x...", // Deployment related address
      "gasLimit": "...",
      "gasPerPubdataByteLimit": "...",
      "maxFeePerGas": "...",
      "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "...",
      "paymaster": 0,
      "nonce": 1, // Or appropriate nonce
      "value": 0,
      "data": "0xContractBytecodeAndArgs...",
      "factoryDeps": ["0xContractBytecode..."],
      "paymasterInput": "0x",
      // Plus signature fields added after signing
      "customSignature": "0x...", // The signature generated
      "hash": "0x..." // The hash of the transaction
    }
    ```

**Links or Resources Mentioned**

*   **Remix IDE:** The development environment used.
*   **zkSync Remix Plugin:** The specific tool used to compile and deploy to zkSync from Remix.
*   **MetaMask:** The wallet used to sign the Type 113 message.

**Notes or Tips Mentioned**

*   When using the zkSync Remix plugin, compilation happens via `zksolc`, not the standard `solc`.
*   Deploying contracts to zkSync using this plugin method results in a `TxType: 113` signature request in the wallet, not a standard transaction confirmation.
*   The structure of the data presented in the Type 113 signature request is user-friendly and broken down into named fields, similar to EIP-712.

    *   **Answer (Partial):** It's a specific zkSync transaction type used for deployment via the Remix plugin, which involves signing a structured message. A full explanation is promised next.
*   **Question (Explicit):** How come we were in Remix and expected to do a transaction, but instead we're signing a message (for deployment)?
