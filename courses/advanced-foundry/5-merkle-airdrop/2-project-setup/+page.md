## Creating a Foundry Script to Claim Merkle Airdrops

This lesson guides you through creating an interaction script using Foundry to claim tokens from a deployed `MerkleAirdrop.sol` contract. Specifically, we'll focus on a common and powerful pattern: claiming the airdrop *on behalf of* an eligible recipient using their signature.

The core idea is that an account eligible for the airdrop (meaning their address is included in the Merkle tree) can sign a message authorizing the claim. Another account, which runs our Foundry script, can then take this signature and the corresponding Merkle proof to execute the claim transaction. The crucial part is that the tokens are sent to the original eligible address, not the account running the script. This allows for scenarios like gas sponsoring, where a third party pays the transaction fees for users to claim their tokens.

## Setting Up the Claiming Script (`Interact.s.sol`)

First, we need to create the script file within our Foundry project. Navigate to your `script` directory and create a new file named `Interact.s.sol`.

We'll start with the standard Solidity pragmas and necessary imports:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import { Script } from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import { DevOpsTools } from "foundry-devops/src/DevOpsTools.sol";
import { MerkleAirdrop } from "../src/MerkleAirdrop.sol";
```

Let's break down these imports:

1.  **`Script`**: This is the base contract provided by `forge-std` (Foundry Standard Library) that all Foundry scripts inherit from. It gives us access to cheatcodes and the standard script execution structure.
2.  **`DevOpsTools`**: A helpful utility contract, often found in libraries like `foundry-devops`. We'll use it to easily find the address of our most recently deployed `MerkleAirdrop` contract on a specific chain.
    *   *Note on Paths & Remappings:* Clean import paths like `foundry-devops/src/DevOpsTools.sol` (without `lib/`) are often achieved by setting up remappings in your `foundry.toml` file (e.g., `foundry-devops/=lib/foundry-devops/`). This keeps your import statements concise.
3.  **`MerkleAirdrop`**: We import our own `MerkleAirdrop` contract definition. This is essential because the script needs the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI) to know how to correctly format the call to its `claim` function.

## Defining the Script Contract and Entry Point

Now, let's define the structure of our script contract. We'll name it `ClaimAirdrop` and make it inherit from the `Script` contract we imported.

```solidity
contract ClaimAirdrop is Script {

    function run() external {
        // Get the address of the deployed MerkleAirdrop contract
        address mostRecentlyDeployed = DevOpsTools.get_most_recent_deployment(
            "MerkleAirdrop", // Contract name
            block.chainid   // Target chain ID
        );

        // Call our helper function to perform the claim
        claimAirdrop(mostRecentlyDeployed);
    }

    // Helper function to contain the claiming logic (defined next)
    function claimAirdrop(address airdrop) public {
        // ... claiming logic goes here ...
    }
}
```

The `run()` function is the standard entry point for Foundry scripts. Inside `run()`, we perform two key actions:

1.  **Find the Contract Address**: We use `DevOpsTools.get_most_recent_deployment`, passing the name of the contract ("MerkleAirdrop") and the current chain ID (`block.chainid`). This function retrieves the address where the `MerkleAirdrop` contract was last deployed on the network the script is targeting.
2.  **Call Helper Function**: We delegate the actual claiming logic to a separate helper function, `claimAirdrop`, passing the retrieved contract address to it. This promotes modularity.

## Implementing the Claim Logic

The `claimAirdrop` function handles the interaction with the deployed contract. It takes the airdrop contract's address as an argument.

```solidity
    // Helper function to contain the claiming logic
    function claimAirdrop(address airdrop) public {
        // Define claim parameters first (address, amount, proof)
        address CLAIMING_ADDRESS = 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266; // Example: Anvil Address 2
        uint256 CLAIMING_AMOUNT = 25 * 1e18; // Example: 25 tokens (18 decimals)

        // Proof needs to be fetched from your output.json for the CLAIMING_ADDRESS
        bytes32 PROOF_ONE = 0xSOME_PROOF_HASH_1; // Replace with actual proof hash
        bytes32 PROOF_TWO = 0xSOME_PROOF_HASH_2; // Replace with actual proof hash

        bytes32[] memory proof = new bytes32[](2); // Assuming proof depth is 2
        proof[0] = PROOF_ONE;
        proof[1] = PROOF_TWO;

        // Define signature components (v, r, s) - these need to be generated externally
        uint8 v = 0; // Placeholder
        bytes32 r = bytes32(0); // Placeholder
        bytes32 s = bytes32(0); // Placeholder

        // Broadcast the transaction
        vm.startBroadcast();

        // Call the claim function on the MerkleAirdrop contract
        MerkleAirdrop(airdrop).claim(
            CLAIMING_ADDRESS,
            CLAIMING_AMOUNT,
            proof,
            v,
            r,
            s
        );

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
```

Inside this function:

1.  **Define Parameters**: We first define the parameters needed for the `claim` call. These include the eligible recipient's address (`CLAIMING_ADDRESS`), the amount they are eligible for (`CLAIMING_AMOUNT`), and their corresponding Merkle `proof`. (More on defining these in the next section). We also include placeholders for the signature components (`v`, `r`, `s`).
2.  **Broadcast Transaction**: Any state-changing calls (like our `claim` function) executed within a Foundry script must be wrapped between `vm.startBroadcast()` and `vm.stopBroadcast()`. This tells Foundry to actually send these calls as transactions to the target network using the configured broadcaster account.
3.  **Call `claim`**: We cast the `airdrop` address to the `MerkleAirdrop` interface type. This allows us to call its `claim` function directly, passing in all the required parameters: the recipient's address, the amount, the proof, and the signature components (`v`, `r`, `s`).

## Defining Claim Parameters

To successfully call the `claim` function, we need concrete values for `CLAIMING_ADDRESS`, `CLAIMING_AMOUNT`, and `proof`.

*   **`CLAIMING_ADDRESS`**: This is the address *for whom* we are claiming. It must be an address present in the original `input.json` used to generate the Merkle tree. For local testing with Anvil, you might use one of the default Anvil addresses (like the second one, `0xf39...`) if it was included in your airdrop list.
    ```solidity
    // Example using Anvil's second default address
    address CLAIMING_ADDRESS = 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266;
    ```
*   **`CLAIMING_AMOUNT`**: This must exactly match the amount specified for the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS` in the `input.json`. Ensure you account for token decimals (e.g., `* 1e18` for 18 decimals).
    ```solidity
    // Example: 25 tokens with 18 decimals
    uint256 CLAIMING_AMOUNT = 25 * 1e18;
    ```
*   **`proof`**: This is the array of `bytes32` hashes that prove the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS` and `CLAIMING_AMOUNT` pair is part of the generated Merkle root. **Crucially, you must retrieve these specific proof hashes from the `output.json` file** (or equivalent output) generated by your Merkle tree creation script (e.g., `MakeMerkle.s.sol`). Find the entry corresponding to the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS` and copy the proof array values.
    ```solidity
    // Replace with actual proof hashes from your output.json for CLAIMING_ADDRESS
    bytes32 PROOF_ONE = 0xd1445c931158119d0449fffca3c947d028c8c359c34a664d95962b3b55c6ad;
    bytes32 PROOF_TWO = 0xe5ebd1e1b5a5478a944eca36a3d6b954ac3bddd216875f6524ca7a1d87096576;

    bytes32[] memory proof = new bytes32[](2); // Adjust size based on your proof length
    proof[0] = PROOF_ONE;
    proof[1] = PROOF_TWO;
    ```

With these values defined, the script has almost everything needed to call the `claim` function.

## Handling the Required Signature (v, r, s)

The final missing pieces are the signature components: `v`, `r`, and `s`. These constitute an ECDSA signature. This signature *must* be generated by the owner of the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS`'s private key, signing a specific message hash (often an EIP-712 compliant hash derived from the claim details, as defined in your `MerkleAirdrop` contract).

How do we get this signature into our script? Foundry offers a couple of approaches:

1.  **`vm.sign(privateKey, digest)`**: A cheatcode available within scripts and tests. If the script runner *has access* to the private key of the `CLAIMING_ADDRESS` (common during testing with known Anvil keys), they can use this cheatcode to generate the signature directly within the script. You would first compute the correct message `digest` to be signed.
2.  **`cast wallet sign <message> --private-key <key>`**: A command-line tool part of Foundry's `cast` suite. This allows generating a signature outside the script execution flow. The eligible user (`CLAIMING_ADDRESS` owner) could run this command using their private key and provide the resulting signature string to the script runner.

For demonstrating the "claim on behalf of" scenario where the script runner *doesn't* necessarily possess the recipient's private key, using `cast wallet sign` is often more representative. The user provides their signature, and the script uses it.

When using `cast wallet sign`, it typically outputs a single `bytes` string representing the concatenated signature (`r` + `s` + `v`). Therefore, within our `ClaimAirdrop` script, we would need to:

1.  Receive this combined `bytes` signature (perhaps as an environment variable or hardcoded temporarily).
2.  Write helper code (using assembly or a library) to parse this `bytes` string and extract the individual `uint8 v`, `bytes32 r`, and `bytes32 s` components.

These extracted components would then replace the placeholder values for `v`, `r`, and `s` before calling the `MerkleAirdrop(airdrop).claim(...)` function. The detailed implementation of signature generation using `cast` and parsing the resulting bytes within the script would be the next step in completing this interaction script.
