We want to make our token work cross-chain. We want to be able to send our tokens from one chain to another. So we need to enable our token for Chainlink CCIP as the video just told us. So if we head to the Chainlink documentation, then you can read all about Chainlink CCIP and all of the other Chainlink products but obviously, in this project we are going to be focusing on CCIP. And then if we head down into guides, then there's this cross-chain token standard section. And now, of course, we know all about the cross-chain token standard. So we can go ahead and start building the cross-chain token standard into our project. So, if we head down to register from an EOA and then the Foundry version, then we have a nice little guide teaching us how to create a cross-chain token and we are going to be creating a Burn and Mint cross-chain token where the pool contract as we were explaining in the previous video is going to be managing those cross-chain transfers and it will burn the tokens on the source chain and mint the tokens on the destination chain. And then if you're if you're bridging from the destination chain back to the source chain, the same thing will happen. So, it'll burn those tokens on the destination chain, and then mint them on the source chain. So the first thing that we need to do is to deploy a token pool for our token. So, actually, we are going to be creating our own custom token pool, because there's some extra information that is going to be needed to pass cross-chain, when we bridge our tokens or transfer them cross-chain. So, we need to create our own token pool. And actually, there is a little bit of sneaky information about custom pools. So, if we head down into concepts and then there's also a cross-chain token standard section inside concepts, and then down in custom token pools, you can see some information about those, and actually, it has a section on rebasing tokens here. Now, the way that we've done it is a little bit differently, but essentially we need to create a custom token pool, which needs to inherit from the token pool contract. So, if we look here, then you can see inside the CCIP repo which we are going to import, there's this token pool contract that we need to inherit. So, we can go through that in a second. And, so you can see here, it says about custom token pools, and we are going to be doing a Burn and Mint mechanism. So, we need to inherit from this Burn Mint Token Pool abstract. So, if we open that in a new tab, then you can see that this Burn Mint Pool abstract inherits from this Token Pool, and then implements lock or burn and release or mint. And, then has this burn function that you can implement yourself. However, we are just going to be inheriting from the Token Pool contract ourselves, because we are going to be creating a custom lock or burn and release or mint function. We could inherit from this contract and then just override these, but to make it simpler, we are simply just going to inherit this token pool contract ourselves. So, we are also doing some funny stuff in here to do with decimals. So, we're As through the token pool data, we are passing through the decimals, and then we are calculating the local amount using the amount that we pass through the decimals, and then calculating the local amount on the destination chain using the decimals in this smart contract and the reason we're doing that in this smart contract is actually not relevant to us, because this is in an instance where your decimals are different on one chain versus the other, um but that is not the case for us. So, all we need to do is create our own token pool and actually, there is a little bit of sneaky information about custom pools. So, if we head down into concepts and then there's also a cross-chain token standard section inside concepts, and then down in custom token pools, you can see some information about those, and actually, it has a section on rebasing tokens here.

We could inherit from this contract and then just override these, but to make it simpler, we are simply just going to inherit this token pool contract ourselves. So, we are also doing some funny stuff in here to do with decimals. So, we're As through the token pool data, we are passing through the decimals, and then we are calculating the local amount using the amount that we pass through the decimals, and then calculating the local amount on the destination chain using the decimals in this smart contract and the reason we're doing that in this smart contract is actually not relevant to us, because this is in an instance where your decimals are different on one chain versus the other, um but that is not the case for us. So, all we need to do is create our own token pool and actually, there is a little bit of sneaky information about custom pools. So, if we head down into concepts and then there's also a cross-chain token standard section inside concepts, and then down in custom token pools, you can see some information about those, and actually, it has a section on rebasing tokens here. Now, the way that we've done it is a little bit differently, but essentially we need to create a custom token pool, which needs to inherit from the token pool contract. So, if we look here, then you can see inside the CCIP repo which we are going to import, there's this token pool contract that we need to inherit. So, we can go through that in a second. And, so you can see here, it says about custom token pools, and we are going to be doing a Burn and Mint mechanism. So, we need to inherit from this Burn Mint Token Pool abstract. So, if we open that in a new tab, then you can see that this Burn Mint Pool abstract inherits from this Token Pool, and then implements lock or burn and release or mint. And, then has this burn function that you can implement yourself. However, we are just going to be inheriting from the Token Pool contract ourselves, because we are going to be creating a custom lock or burn and release or mint function. We could inherit from this contract and then just override these, but to make it simpler, we are simply just going to inherit this token pool contract ourselves. So, we are also doing some funny stuff in here to do with decimals. So, we're As
