## Finalizing the Rebase Token Contract

This lesson walks through the final stages of implementing a custom `RebaseToken.sol` smart contract in Solidity. Building upon OpenZeppelin's standard ERC20 implementation, we'll integrate a rebasing mechanism to allow user balances to accrue interest over time. We'll review the necessary function overrides, discuss design choices, add helper functions, and identify the critical next step: access control.

## Core Concepts: Rebasing and ERC20 Overrides

Our `RebaseToken` contract introduces the concept of **rebasing**, where a user's token balance implicitly grows based on an interest rate without requiring explicit transaction minting for every interest accrual event. This core feature necessitates modifying standard ERC20 behavior.

Key concepts include:

1.  **ERC20 Foundation:** We inherit from OpenZeppelin's `ERC20.sol`, leveraging its robust implementation of standard functions like `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `approve`, `allowance`, etc.
2.  **Rebasing Logic:** Balances reflect both minted tokens and accrued interest since the user's last interaction. This primarily affects how balances are read (`balanceOf`) and updated during transfers or mint/burn operations.
3.  **Interest Rate Mechanics:**
    *   `s_interestRate`: A global rate for the contract.
    *   `s_userInterestRate`: Each user receives a specific rate, captured from the global rate upon their first token receipt.
    *   `s_userLastUpdatedTimestamp`: Tracks the last time a user's interest was calculated and balance updated.
4.  **Precision:** A `PRECISION_FACTOR` (1e18) is used for accurate fixed-point arithmetic in interest calculations.
5.  **`super` Keyword:** Used to call functions from the parent `ERC20` contract when extending or modifying their behavior.

## Reviewing Standard ERC20 Functions

Before implementing custom logic, we identify which standard ERC20 functions provided by OpenZeppelin require modification for our rebasing mechanism.

*   **No Override Needed:** `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()`, `allowance()`, `approve()`. These functions operate independently of the rebasing logic and can be inherited directly. Similarly, the internal functions (`_transfer`, `_update`, `_mint`, `_burn`, `_approve`, `_spendAllowance`) within OpenZeppelin's implementation are suitable for our needs.
*   **Override Required/Considered:** `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf(address)`, `transfer(address, uint256)`, `transferFrom(address, address, uint256)`. These functions interact directly with token balances or the total supply, which are affected by the rebasing.

## Implementing Contract Logic and Overrides

We now implement or override the necessary functions, incorporating the rebasing logic.

### `totalSupply()` - A Design Trade-off

The standard `totalSupply()` returns the internal `_totalSupply` counter, tracking only explicitly minted and burned tokens. Modifying this to calculate the *true* total supply, including all un-minted accrued interest across all users, would require iterating through every user who has ever held the token. This is computationally expensive (high gas costs) and potentially creates a denial-of-service (DoS) vector.

**Decision:** We leave `totalSupply()` unmodified. It will **not** reflect the total effective balance including accrued interest. This is a documented design trade-off prioritizing gas efficiency and security over absolute accuracy of this specific metric.

### `balanceOf(address _user)` - Calculating Effective Balance

This function must be overridden to return the user's balance *including* any interest accrued since their last interaction.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate the interest multiplier accrued since `s_userLastUpdatedTimestamp[_user]` using a helper function (`_calculateUserAccumulatedInterestSinceLastUpdate`).
2.  Fetch the user's principal (minted) balance using `super.balanceOf(_user)`.
3.  Apply the interest multiplier: `effectiveBalance = principalBalance * interestMultiplier / PRECISION_FACTOR`.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Gets the balance of the specified address, including accrued interest.
     * @param _user The address to query the balance of.
     * @return The balance of the user, including accrued interest.
     */
    function balanceOf(address _user) public view override returns (uint256) {
        // Note: Assumes _calculateUserAccumulatedInterestSinceLastUpdate(_user) returns the interest factor correctly
        // The exact implementation of _calculateUserAccumulatedInterestSinceLastUpdate is not detailed here but is crucial.
        return super.balanceOf(_user) * _calculateUserAccumulatedInterestSinceLastUpdate(_user) / PRECISION_FACTOR;
    }
```

### `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)` - Adding New Tokens

This function handles the creation of new tokens, typically when users deposit underlying assets into a related vault.

**Logic:**
1.  **Update Recipient's Balance:** Call `_mintAccruedInterest(_to)` *before* minting new tokens to ensure their existing balance is up-to-date with interest.
2.  **Set Interest Rate:** Assign the current global `s_interestRate` to the recipient: `s_userInterestRate[_to] = s_interestRate;`. This rate applies to their *entire* balance going forward.
3.  **Mint Tokens:** Call the inherited internal `_mint(_to, _amount)` function.
4.  **Access Control:** This function currently lacks access control and *must* be restricted (e.g., using `Ownable`) so only authorized actors can mint.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Mints tokens to a user and sets their interest rate.
     * @dev Needs access control. Should only be callable by authorized contract (e.g., Vault).
     * @param _to The address to mint tokens to.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to mint.
     */
    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external { // !! IMPORTANT: Add access control later !!
        _mintAccruedInterest(_to); // Update interest before minting
        s_userInterestRate[_to] = s_interestRate; // Set user's rate to current global rate
        _mint(_to, _amount); // Perform the actual mint using OZ's internal function
    }
```

### `burn(address _from, uint256 _amount)` - Removing Tokens

This function handles the destruction of tokens, typically upon withdrawal from a vault.

**Logic:**
1.  **Handle Max Burn:** Allow burning the entire balance by passing `type(uint256).max` as the amount. If detected, set `_amount` to the user's *effective* balance (`balanceOf(_from)`).
2.  **Update Sender's Balance:** Call `_mintAccruedInterest(_from)` *before* burning to ensure the correct amount is burned after accounting for interest.
3.  **Burn Tokens:** Call the inherited internal `_burn(_from, _amount)` function.
4.  **Access Control:** Like `mint`, this requires access control.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Burns tokens from a user.
     * @dev Needs access control. Should only be callable by authorized contract (e.g., Vault).
     * @param _from The address to burn tokens from.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to burn. Use type(uint256).max to burn all tokens.
     */
    function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) external { // !! IMPORTANT: Add access control later !!
        uint256 currentBalance = balanceOf(_from); // Get effective balance
        if (_amount == type(uint256).max) {
            _amount = currentBalance;
        }
        _mintAccruedInterest(_from); // Update interest before burning
        // Note: A check like require(_amount <= super.balanceOf(_from), "Burn amount exceeds principal") might be needed after _mintAccruedInterest
        _burn(_from, _amount); // Perform the actual burn using OZ's internal function
    }
```

### `transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)` - Standard Transfer with Interest Logic

Overrides the standard ERC20 transfer to incorporate interest accrual and user rate handling.

**Logic:**
1.  **Update Balances:** Update interest for both sender (`msg.sender`) and `_recipient` by calling `_mintAccruedInterest` for each.
2.  **Handle Max Transfer:** Allow transferring the entire balance using `type(uint256).max`.
3.  **Set Recipient Rate (First Time Only):** If the recipient's *effective* balance (`balanceOf(_recipient)`) is zero *before* the transfer, set their interest rate (`s_userInterestRate[_recipient]`) to the *sender's* rate (`s_userInterestRate[msg.sender]`). This assigns a rate upon first receipt but avoids overwriting an existing rate. This is a known design feature/trade-off.
4.  **Perform Transfer:** Call `super.transfer(_recipient, _amount)` to execute the underlying ERC20 transfer logic.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Transfers tokens from caller to recipient, updating interest and setting recipient rate if new.
     * @param _recipient The address to transfer tokens to.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer. Use type(uint256).max to transfer all tokens.
     * @return A boolean indicating success.
     */
    function transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) public override returns (bool) {
        _mintAccruedInterest(msg.sender);
        _mintAccruedInterest(_recipient); // Update interest for both parties

        uint256 senderBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender); // Get effective balance for max transfer check
        if (_amount == type(uint256).max) {
            _amount = senderBalance;
        }

        // Set interest rate for recipient ONLY if they have no balance yet (before this transfer)
        // Note: balanceOf check happens *after* _mintAccruedInterest for the recipient.
        if (balanceOf(_recipient) == 0) {
             // Check if sender has a rate set. If not, perhaps default to global rate or leave 0? Design decision.
            s_userInterestRate[_recipient] = s_userInterestRate[msg.sender];
        }

        return super.transfer(_recipient, _amount); // Perform the transfer using OZ's logic
    }
```

### `transferFrom(address _sender, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)` - Allowance Transfer

Overrides the standard `transferFrom` to mirror the logic added in `transfer`, ensuring consistency for transfers initiated via allowances.

**Logic:** Identical to `transfer`, but uses `_sender` instead of `msg.sender` for balance checks, interest updates, and rate propagation. It calls `super.transferFrom` at the end.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Transfers tokens from sender to recipient using allowance, updating interest and setting recipient rate if new.
     * @param _sender The address to transfer tokens from.
     * @param _recipient The address to transfer tokens to.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer. Use type(uint256).max to transfer all tokens based on sender's balance.
     * @return A boolean indicating success.
     */
    function transferFrom(address _sender, address _recipient, uint256 _amount) public override returns (bool) {
        _mintAccruedInterest(_sender);
        _mintAccruedInterest(_recipient); // Update interest for both parties

        uint256 senderBalance = balanceOf(_sender); // Get effective balance for max transfer check
        if (_amount == type(uint256).max) {
            _amount = senderBalance;
        }

        // Set interest rate for recipient ONLY if they have no balance yet (before this transfer)
        if (balanceOf(_recipient) == 0) {
            s_userInterestRate[_recipient] = s_userInterestRate[_sender];
        }

        return super.transferFrom(_sender, _recipient, _amount); // Perform the transfer using OZ's logic
    }
```

## Adding Helper Getter Functions

To provide better visibility into the contract's state, we add specific getter functions.

### `principleBalanceOf(address _user)`

Returns the user's balance *without* accrued interest – the actual number of tokens minted to them.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Get the principle balance of a user. This is the number of tokens that have currently been minted to the user, not including any interest that has accrued since the last time the user interacted with the protocol.
     * @param _user The user to get the principle balance for
     * @return The principle balance of the user
     */
    function principleBalanceOf(address _user) external view returns (uint256) {
        // Calls the parent ERC20's balanceOf, which tracks only minted/burned amounts
        return super.balanceOf(_user);
    }
```

### `getInterestRate()`

Returns the current *global* interest rate of the contract.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Get the interest rate that is currently set for the contract. Any future depositors will receive this interest rate
     * @return The interest rate for the contract
     */
    function getInterestRate() external view returns (uint256) {
        return s_interestRate;
    }
```

### `getUserInterestRate(address _user)`

Returns the specific interest rate assigned to a particular user.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Get the specific interest rate assigned to a user.
     * @param _user The user to query the interest rate for.
     * @return The interest rate assigned to the user.
     */
    function getUserInterestRate(address _user) external view returns (uint256) {
        return s_userInterestRate[_user];
    }
```

## Documenting and Final Steps: Access Control

Throughout the implementation, we've used NatSpec comments (`@notice`, `@param`, `@return`, `@dev`) to document the functions' purpose and behavior. This is crucial for clarity and maintainability.

**The most critical remaining step is implementing Access Control.** Currently, sensitive functions like `mint`, `burn`, and any function to set `s_interestRate` (not shown, but necessary) are `external` or `public` without restrictions. This means *anyone* could call them, rendering the contract insecure and unusable in a real-world scenario.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Implement Access Control:** Add a mechanism like OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or a more complex role-based system to restrict who can call `mint`, `burn`, and administrative functions (like setting the interest rate).
2.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all functions, including edge cases related to interest accrual, zero balances, max value transfers, and access control restrictions.

With access control implemented, the `RebaseToken.sol` contract will have its core functionality complete, demonstrating how to extend standard ERC20 tokens with custom logic like interest accrual while managing important design trade-offs.
