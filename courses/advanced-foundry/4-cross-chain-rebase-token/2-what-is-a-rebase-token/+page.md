## What is a Rebase Token?

Have you ever wondered why your token balance can change without you buying or selling? These are a type of token called rebase tokens.

A rebase token is a type of token or cryptocurrency where the total supply adjusts based on a specific algorithm to reflect changes in underlying value or accrued rewards rather than the price of the token changing. These adjustments are called rebases.

There are two main types of rebased tokens. The first kind is for earning rewards, like interest in lending or borrowing. And the second kind focuses on keeping the token's value stable regardless of market fluctuations.

For example, let's say you hold a thousand tokens and the protocol decides to perform a positive rebase to distribute 10% interest. Your wallet balance will automatically adjust to 1,100 tokens. The best part, your ownership percentage of the total supply remains unchanged as everyone's balance increases by the same percentage.

Let's take a real-world example. Look at Aave's aToken. This is an example of a rebase token as you can see this _balance of_ function. With rebase tokens, the _balance of_ function will be dynamic. So you can see here is calculating the accumulated interest and returning this calculation. When you deposit into Aave, you're essentially lending the amount to earn some interest. In return, you receive aTokens like aUSDC or aDAI, which represent your deposit. These tokens automatically adjust their supply to reflect the interest you earn and allow you to withdraw your deposit and accrued interest anytime.

For example, let's say you deposit 1,000 USDC into Aave and the annual interest rate is 5%. Your aUSDC balance will grow to 1,050 over the course of a year.
