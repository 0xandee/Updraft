## Crafting an Unsigned PackedUserOperation for ERC-4337

This lesson focuses on a crucial preliminary step in interacting with ERC-4337 Account Abstraction: generating an *unsigned* `PackedUserOperation` struct. This forms the foundation for creating a fully signed operation, which is essential for testing functions like `validateUserOp` within a smart contract account.

**Context and Motivation**

Previously, you might have tested the `execute` function of a smart contract account, such as `MinimalAccount.sol`. The next logical step is to test the `validateUserOp` function. To do this effectively, we need to construct a valid `PackedUserOperation` struct, its corresponding hash (`userOpHash`), and potentially any `missingAccountFunds`.

A complete `PackedUserOperation` requires a signature from the account owner. Instead of embedding the complex logic for creating and signing this operation directly within our test files (e.g., `MinimalAccountTest.t.sol`), we'll build this functionality within a Foundry script file (`SendPackedUserOp.s.sol`). This approach offers several advantages:
1.  **Reusability:** A script for sending user operations will likely be necessary for interacting with the account on testnets or mainnet.
2.  **Testability:** The logic developed in the script, especially for generating the operation data, can be imported and utilized within Foundry tests.
3.  **Focused Testing:** This allows us to test the signature generation process itself within our test environment.

**The `PackedUserOperation` Struct**

The central data structure we're working with is `PackedUserOperation`. It's typically imported from an account abstraction library (e.g., `lib/account-abstraction/contracts/interfaces/PackedUserOperation.sol`). For this lesson, the relevant fields are:

```solidity
struct PackedUserOperation {
    address sender;           // The account sending the operation.
    uint256 nonce;            // Anti-replay protection nonce.
    bytes initCode;           // Code to deploy the account if it doesn't exist (ignored for now).
    bytes callData;           // The actual transaction data (function call) to execute.
    bytes32 accountGasLimits; // Packed verificationGasLimit and callGasLimit.
    uint256 preVerificationGas; // Gas limit for pre-verification steps.
    bytes32 gasFees;          // Packed maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas.
    bytes paymasterAndData;   // Data for paymaster interaction (ignored for now).
    bytes signature;          // The signature validating the operation (left blank for unsigned).
}
```

**Building the `SendPackedUserOp.s.sol` Script**

We'll create a new Foundry script file named `SendPackedUserOp.s.sol` to house our logic.

1.  **Basic Script Structure:**
    The script begins with the standard SPDX license, pragma version, and necessary imports. We import `Script` from `forge-std` and the `PackedUserOperation` struct.

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.24;

    import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
    import {PackedUserOperation} from "lib/account-abstraction/contracts/interfaces/PackedUserOperation.sol";

    contract SendPackedUserOp is Script {
        function run() public {} // Entry point for script execution, empty for now

        // Helper functions will be defined below
    }
    ```

2.  **Main Function: `generateSignedUserOperation` (Initial Version)**
    Our primary goal is to create a function that will eventually return a *signed* `PackedUserOperation`. For now, it will lay the groundwork and prepare the unsigned version.

    ```solidity
    function generatedSignedUserOperation(bytes memory callData, address sender)
        public // Not 'view' or 'pure' as it will use vm cheatcodes for nonce and later for signing
        returns (PackedUserOperation memory)
    {
        // Step 1: Generate the unsigned UserOperation data
        uint256 nonce = vm.getNonce(sender); // Fetch current nonce for the sender

        PackedUserOperation memory unsignedUserOp = _generateUnsignedUserOperation(
            callData,
            sender,
            nonce
        );

        // Step 2: Sign the UserOperation (to be implemented later)
        // For now, we'll return the unsigned version
        return unsignedUserOp;
    }
    ```
    In this function, we use the Foundry cheatcode `vm.getNonce(sender)` to retrieve the current nonce for the `sender` address. This is crucial for replay protection.

3.  **Helper Function: `_generateUnsignedUserOperation`**
    To maintain clean and organized code, we'll create an internal helper function dedicated to populating the `PackedUserOperation` struct *without* the signature.

    ```solidity
    function _generateUnsignedUserOperation(bytes memory callData, address sender, uint256 nonce)
        internal
        pure // This function doesn't read state or use cheatcodes
        returns (PackedUserOperation memory)
    {
        // Example gas parameters (these may need tuning)
        uint128 verificationGasLimit = 16777216; 
        uint128 callGasLimit = verificationGasLimit; // Often different in practice
        uint128 maxPriorityFeePerGas = 256; 
        uint128 maxFeePerGas = maxPriorityFeePerGas; // Simplification for example

        // Pack accountGasLimits: (verificationGasLimit << 128) | callGasLimit
        bytes32 accountGasLimits = bytes32(
            (uint256(verificationGasLimit) << 128) | uint256(callGasLimit)
        );

        // Pack gasFees: (maxFeePerGas << 128) | maxPriorityFeePerGas
        bytes32 gasFees = bytes32(
            (uint256(maxFeePerGas) << 128) | uint256(maxPriorityFeePerGas)
        );

        return PackedUserOperation({
            sender: sender,
            nonce: nonce,
            initCode: hex"", // Empty for existing accounts
            callData: callData,
            accountGasLimits: accountGasLimits,
            preVerificationGas: verificationGasLimit, // Often related to verificationGasLimit
            gasFees: gasFees,
            paymasterAndData: hex"", // Empty if not using a paymaster
            signature: hex"" // Crucially, the signature is blank for an unsigned operation
        });
    }
    ```

    **Key aspects of `_generateUnsignedUserOperation`:**
    *   **Gas Parameters:** The `verificationGasLimit`, `callGasLimit`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, and `maxFeePerGas` are provided as example values. In a real-world scenario, these would require careful calculation or dynamic retrieval based on network conditions and operation complexity.
    *   **Packing Gas Limits and Fees:** The `accountGasLimits` field (a `bytes32`) packs two `uint128` values: `verificationGasLimit` and `callGasLimit`. This is achieved by left-shifting the `verificationGasLimit` by 128 bits and then performing a bitwise OR operation with `callGasLimit`. A similar process is used for `gasFees`, packing `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. Both `uint128` values are first cast to `uint256` before bitwise operations.
    *   **Ignored Fields:**
        *   `initCode`: This field is left empty (`hex""`) because we are assuming the smart contract account (`sender`) already exists. It's only used when deploying a new account via a user operation.
        *   `paymasterAndData`: This is also left empty, assuming no paymaster is involved in sponsoring gas fees for this operation.
    *   **Signature Field:** The `signature` field is explicitly set to `hex""`. This is the defining characteristic of an *unsigned* `PackedUserOperation`.

By calling `_generateUnsignedUserOperation` from `generatedSignedUserOperation`, we now have a structured way to create the data payload of a user operation before it's signed.

**Key Concepts Recap**

*   **ERC-4337 & Account Abstraction:** The overarching framework that necessitates `PackedUserOperation` for user-initiated actions.
*   **`PackedUserOperation`:** The core data structure that bundles a user's intent, replacing traditional transactions for smart contract accounts.
*   **Unsigned Operation:** The `PackedUserOperation` struct populated with all necessary data *except* the cryptographic signature.
*   **Foundry Scripts (`.s.sol`):** Used for deployment, interaction, and complex setup logic that can be reused in tests.
*   **Foundry Cheatcodes:** Tools like `vm.getNonce()` allow scripts and tests to interact with and query the blockchain virtual machine's state.
*   **Bit Shifting and Packing:** A technique to efficiently store multiple smaller data values within a single larger field (e.g., two `uint128` values in one `bytes32`).
*   **Helper Functions:** A good practice for modularizing code, making it more readable and maintainable.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Gas Parameterization:** The hardcoded gas limits and fee values (`verificationGasLimit`, `callGasLimit`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`) are illustrative. In practice, these are critical and complex. Incorrect values can lead to operation failure. They often need to be estimated or determined dynamically.
*   **`initCode` Usage:** Only populate `initCode` if the user operation is intended to deploy a new smart contract account. For operations targeting existing accounts, it must be empty.
*   **Paymaster Logic:** The `paymasterAndData` field is only relevant when employing a paymaster to cover gas costs.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Generating the unsigned data payload separately from the signing process is a clean architectural choice.

**Next Steps**

With the `_generateUnsignedUserOperation` helper in place and `generatedSignedUserOperation` set up to produce the unsigned struct, the next logical step (to be covered subsequently) involves:
1.  Calculating the `userOpHash` of the `unsignedUserOp`.
2.  Signing this hash using the `sender`'s private key (likely using Foundry cheatcodes like `vm.sign` or by managing private keys within the script).
3.  Populating the `signature` field of the `PackedUserOperation` struct with this cryptographic signature.
4.  Returning the fully populated, *signed* `PackedUserOperation`.

This will complete the `generatedSignedUserOperation` function, enabling us to generate operations ready for validation by the `validateUserOp` function of our smart contract account.
