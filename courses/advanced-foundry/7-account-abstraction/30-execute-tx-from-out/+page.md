## Setting Up Foundry Tests for a zkSync Native Account Abstraction Contract

This lesson guides you through setting up a Foundry test environment for a smart contract specifically designed for zkSync Era's native Account Abstraction (AA) features. We will focus on the `ZkMinimalAccount.sol` contract within the `foundry-account-abstraction` project, creating a test file, implementing basic boilerplate, instantiating the contract, and starting our first test case.

## Creating the zkSync Test File

First, we need to organize our tests. Since we're targeting a zkSync-specific contract (`src/zksync/ZkMinimalAccount.sol`), we'll create a dedicated space for its tests.

1.  Navigate to the `test` directory within your `foundry-account-abstraction` project.
2.  Create a new sub-directory named `zksync` (ensure it's lowercase for consistency).
3.  Inside the `test/zksync/` directory, create a new Foundry test file named `ZkMinimalAccountTest.t.sol`.

This structure keeps our zkSync tests separate from standard Ethereum tests.

## Implementing Basic Foundry Test Boilerplate

Now, let's populate `ZkMinimalAccountTest.t.sol` with the standard Foundry test setup:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

// Import the core Foundry testing library
import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

// Define the test contract, inheriting from Test
contract ZkMinimalAccountTest is Test {

    // setUp function runs before each test case
    function setUp() public {
        // Initial state configuration goes here
    }

    // Test functions will be added below
}
```

This boilerplate includes:
*   SPDX License Identifier and Solidity pragma.
*   Importing the `Test` contract from `forge-std` (Foundry Standard Library).
*   Defining our test contract `ZkMinimalAccountTest` which inherits from `Test`.
*   An empty `setUp` function, a standard Foundry convention for setting up the initial state required by each test function before it runs.

## Understanding zkSync Deployment Considerations in Tests

When testing zkSync contracts, especially those leveraging native features, deployment within a test environment can differ from standard EVM chains or even production zkSync deployments.

You might observe in related repositories (like `github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction`) a conditional deployment approach, potentially using helper functions (e.g., `isZkSyncChain()`) and deployer contracts. This often stems from the fact that, historically, zkSync test environments haven't fully supported all Foundry scripting features or cheat codes in the same way standard EVM chains do. Complex deployment scripts might not execute as expected.

For simplicity in this lesson, we will bypass conditional logic and complex deployment scripts within our test setup. We will directly instantiate the contract using the `new` keyword within the `setUp` function.

Be aware that deploying zkSync contracts to production or more complex testnets might require different approaches, such as using bash scripts that invoke `forge create` commands.

## Importing and Instantiating the Contract Under Test

Let's import `ZkMinimalAccount` and prepare to instantiate it in our tests.

1.  Add the import statement for the contract we intend to test:

```solidity
import {ZkMinimalAccount} from "src/zksync/ZkMinimalAccount.sol";
```

2.  Declare a state variable within `ZkMinimalAccountTest` to hold the instance of our account contract:

```solidity
contract ZkMinimalAccountTest is Test {
    ZkMinimalAccount minimalAccount;

    // ... setUp and other functions
}
```

3.  Instantiate the contract within the `setUp` function so that each test starts with a fresh instance:

```solidity
function setUp() public {
    minimalAccount = new ZkMinimalAccount();
}
```

## Planning the First Test: Adapting for Native AA

Our goal is to write tests similar to those for the standard Ethereum `MinimalAccount` (found in `test/ethereum/MinimalAccountTest.t.sol`), adapting them for zkSync's native AA. We'll start by replicating the logic of `testOwnerCanExecuteCommands`.

A key difference arises here:

*   **Ethereum (ERC-4337 Style):** In the standard test, the owner calls `minimalAccount.execute(dest, value, data)` directly. This simulates an owner interacting with their account outside the Bundler/EntryPoint flow.
*   **zkSync (Native AA):** The equivalent function in `ZkMinimalAccount.sol` is `executeTransaction(Transaction memory _transaction)`. This function expects a specific `Transaction` struct defined by the zkSync protocol. It also includes the `requireFromBootloaderOrOwner` modifier, meaning it can be called by the zkSync system (bootloader) or, crucially for our test, directly by the account's owner.

Therefore, our zkSync test needs to construct this `Transaction` object to call `executeTransaction` as the owner.

## Implementing the First Test: Owner Execution

Let's begin writing the `testZkOwnerCanExecuteCommands` function, focusing on the "Arrange" phase.

1.  Define the test function structure:

```solidity
function testZkOwnerCanExecuteCommands() public {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
}
```

2.  **Arrange Phase - Setup Mock Token:** Like the Ethereum counterpart, we need a mock ERC20 token to interact with.
    *   Import `ERC20Mock` from OpenZeppelin contracts:
        ```solidity
        import {ERC20Mock} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/mocks/token/ERC20Mock.sol";
        ```
    *   Declare a state variable for the mock token and a constant for the amount:
        ```solidity
        contract ZkMinimalAccountTest is Test {
            ZkMinimalAccount minimalAccount;
            ERC20Mock usdc; // Mock USDC token
            uint256 constant AMOUNT = 1e18; // 1 USDC (with 18 decimals)

            // ... setUp and test functions
        }
        ```
    *   Instantiate the mock token in the `setUp` function:
        ```solidity
        function setUp() public {
            minimalAccount = new ZkMinimalAccount();
            usdc = new ERC20Mock(); // Instantiate mock token
        }
        ```

3.  **Arrange Phase - Prepare Execution Parameters:** Inside `testZkOwnerCanExecuteCommands`, set up the parameters needed for the transaction the owner will execute. We want the `minimalAccount` to call the `mint` function on the `usdc` contract.

    *   Set the destination address to the mock USDC contract:
        ```solidity
        function testZkOwnerCanExecuteCommands() public {
            // Arrange
            address dest = address(usdc);
        ```
    *   Set the Ether value to 0 (we are only interacting with the token contract):
        ```solidity
        uint256 value = 0;
        ```
    *   Prepare the `calldata` (function data) for the `mint` call. We want to mint `AMOUNT` tokens *to* the `minimalAccount` itself:
        ```solidity
        bytes memory functionData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            ERC20Mock.mint.selector,    // Function selector for mint(address,uint256)
            address(minimalAccount),    // The recipient of the minted tokens
            AMOUNT                      // The amount of tokens to mint
        );

        // Act phase will follow...
        // Assert phase will follow...
    }
    ```

We have now successfully set up the test file, included basic boilerplate, handled contract instantiation, and arranged the necessary parameters (`dest`, `value`, `functionData`) for our first zkSync native AA test case. The next step would be to construct the zkSync `Transaction` struct and execute the `executeTransaction` function (Act phase), followed by assertions (Assert phase).
