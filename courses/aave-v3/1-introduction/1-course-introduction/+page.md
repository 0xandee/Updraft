## Prerequisites: Setting You Up for Success in This Aave V3 Course

To ensure you derive maximum benefit from this course, a certain level of foundational knowledge is recommended. Please review the following prerequisites:

**1. Fundamental DeFi Terminology:**
A basic understanding of common DeFi concepts and assets is expected:
*   **Stablecoins:** Familiarity with widely used stablecoins such as DAI and USDC.
*   **Wrapped ETH (WETH):** Knowledge of WETH and its purpose within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, particularly its role as a common collateral type.

**2. Intermediate to Advanced Solidity Proficiency:**
Strong Solidity skills are crucial for the practical exercises and the final project:
*   **Upgradeable Proxy Contracts:** A key prerequisite is a solid understanding of how upgradeable proxy contracts function. Aave V3 makes extensive use of proxy patterns; therefore, comprehending their mechanics will significantly simplify your learning journey and your ability to interact effectively with the protocol. While it is possible to follow the course without this specific knowledge, it is highly advantageous.

**3. Advanced Foundry Skills:**
The practical development work in this course will be conducted using Foundry, a popular smart contract development toolchain:
*   **Foundry Proficiency:** You should be comfortable using Foundry for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
*   **Mainnet Fork Testing:** Experience with testing smart contracts on mainnet forks using Foundry is essential for realistic simulation and debugging.
*   **Debugging with Console Log:** Proficiency in utilizing `console.log` (or equivalent Foundry debugging tools) to diagnose and resolve issues in your Solidity code within the Foundry environment is expected.
