In the zkSync module `transactions`, you'll find buttons for calling `SimpleStorage` functions like `addPerson`, `listOfPeople`, `nameToFavoriteNumber`, `retrieve`, and `store`. Clicking the blue buttons will display the output in the terminal, while the orange buttons are used for storing values.

For example, when you click the orange "store" button and enter the input `77`, MetaMask will prompt you for confirmation. Once confirmed, you can click `retrieve` to see the stored value of 77 displayed on Remix. Feel free to experiment with these functions, but keep in mind that the testnet can sometimes be slow.

By following these steps, you have successfully deployed a smart contract on ZK Sync. This process involves bridging testnet funds to ZK Sync and deploying the smart contract on a Layer 2 testnet chain.
