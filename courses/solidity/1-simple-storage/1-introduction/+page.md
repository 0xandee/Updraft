> [!NOTE]
> Each course will have an associated link, where you’ll find all the **code** that you will be working on within in each lesson and a
> **README** section, that contains instructions on how to work with the code.

## Usage of the repository

This repository offers two main benefits:

- **Easy access:** each lesson can be consulted and cloned effortlessly

- **Discussion and Network:** you can engage with fellow students, ask questions, and participate in collaborative learning.

> [!CAUTION]
> To raise issues or start discussions based on a specific repository, please use the [**Discussions tab**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/discussions) of the *Cyfrin Updraft - Career Path* instead of creating issues directly on the repository itself.

## Asking Questions

It’s very likely that during your journey you’ll have questions. It’s recommended to use the [**Q&A**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/discussions/new?category=q-a) section provided inside the discussion tab. You will be guided into how to best formulate your queries, such that have the highest chance of being answered by the community, AI or a forum.

## Setting Up

Before we dive into coding, it is essential that you have access to the code repository and educational resources provided.

Having an account on the following platforms is highly recommended:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Stack Exchange Ethereum](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (remember to always verify its correctness)

## Let's Start Coding!

Now comes the exciting part: building and deploying your first smart contract.
We're going to be utilizing a tool called [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for deploying and interacting with smart contracts. You can access it through this [link](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

> [!TIP]
The best way to get the most out of this guide is to **code along**. You're encouraged to change the speed of the tutorial video to match your coding pace. Remember that **space repetition** is critical while building a new skill.
