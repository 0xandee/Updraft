> [!NOTE]
> In the link associated with this course you’ll find all the **code** that will be explained in the lesson and a
> **README** file, that contains instructions on how to utilize it and how to derive the maximum benefit from it.

## Usage of the repository

This repository offers two main benefits:

- **Easy access:** each lesson can be consulted and cloned effortlessy

- **Discussions and Network:** you can engage with fellow students, ask questions, and participate in collaborative learning.

> [!CAUTION]
> To raise issues or start discussions based on a specific repository, please use the discussions tab of the Foundry Full Course instead of creating issues directly on the repository itself.

## Asking Questions

It’s very likely that during your journey you’ll have questions. It’s recommended to use the Q&A section provided inside the Full Course Discussion tab. You will be guided into how to best ask questions, such that have the highest chance of being answered by the community, AI or forum.

## Setting Up

Before we dive into coding, it is essential that you have access to the code repository and educational resources provided.

Having an accounts on the following platforms is highly recommended:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Stack Exchange Ethereum](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (remember to always verify its correctness)

## Let's Start Coding!

Now it comes the exciting part: building and deploying your first smart contract.
We're going to be utilizing a tool called [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for deploying and interacting with smart contracts. You can access it through this [link](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

> [!TIP]
> The best way to get the most out of this guide is to **code along**. You're encouraged to change the speed on the tutorial video to match your coding pace. Remember that **space repetition** is critical while building a new skill.

## The Deployment Tool: Remix

To plunge into coding, we're going to be using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). You can either Google search it or access it directly from the link provided.

So, let's jump right in and start deploying your first smart contract! By the end of this lesson, you'll have deployed your first smart contract and written your first bit of Solidity code. We can't wait to get through this exciting journey with you!
