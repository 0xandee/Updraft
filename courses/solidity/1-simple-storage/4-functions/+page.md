üìã To store our favourite number, we need to create a new **function**. We'll call it `store`, and it will be responsible for updating the `favoriteNumber` variable.

```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {

    uint256 favoriteNumber; // we need to update this
    
    // we'll update the variable here inside a function 
}
```

## Building the **store** function

In Solidity, functions - or methods, are portions of code designed to execute specific tasks within the overall codebase.

Functions are identified by the keyword `function`, followed by the function's name (e.g. `store`) and any additional **parameters** enclosed in rounded parentheses `()`. 
These parameters represent the values sent to our function. In this cose, we inform the `store` function that we want to update `favoriteNumber` with some other value `_favoriteNumber`:

```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {

    uint256 favoriteNumber; // storage variable: it's stored in a place called "Storage"

    function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
        favoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber; // favorite number variable is updated with the value that is contained into `_favoriteNumber`
    }
}
```
The content of the function is placed within the curly brackets `{}`. 
The prefix `_` before `_favoriteNumber` is used to emphashise that the *local* variable `_favoriteNumber` is a **different** variable from the *state* variable `favoriteNumber`. This helps prevent potential confusion when dealing with different variables with similar names in complex codebases.

## Deploying the Smart Contract

You can test out this function on the Remix VM environment.
At this stage, you can compile your code by navigating to the compile tab and hitting Compile. After compiling, navigate to the tab **Deploy and Run Transactions** to test your function.

The **Deploy and Run Transactions** tab holds a variety of parameters that are used during the deployment process.
You'll be assigned an *account* with some ETH to deploy your smart contract.

üó∫Ô∏è In this environment, your contract is assigned a unique address. You can re-access your deployed contract by expanding the **Deployed Contracts** interface and simultaneously opening the terminal, which shows log data of all contract deployments and transactions.

If we open the terminal we can see that deploying the contract has just sent a simulated transaction on the Remix environment. You can check out its details such as status, hash, from, to and gas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
The process of sending a transaction is the **same** for deploying a contract and for sending Ethers. The only difference is that the machine-readable code of the deployed contract is placed inside the *data* field of the deployment transaction.

### Making Transactions with the Store Function

Let's send a transaction to the `store` function to change the value of the variable `favoriteNumber`: you can insert a number and press the `store` button in Remix. A transaction is initiated and after some time, its status will change from pending to complete.

From the accounts section, it becomes visible that ETH is being consumed every time a transaction is submitted. When the state of the blockchain is modified (e.g. deploying a contract, sending ETH, ..), is done by sending a transaction that consumes gas. Executing the `store` function is more expensive than just transferring ETH between accounts, with the rising gas expenses primarily associated (though not exclusively) with the code length.

### Checking the stored value

üëì This contract is missing a way to check if the number has been updated. Now we can store a value but we cannot be sure if the transaction **actually** changed the state variable.

The default visibility of the `favoriteNumber` variable is internal, disallowing outside contracts and people from view it. Appending the `public` keyword next to this variable will automatically change its visibility and it will generate a getter function.

```solidity
uint256 public favoriteNumber;
```

After compilation and deployment, a button labelled `favoriteNumber` will become visible. When pressed, it should return the most recent stored value of the variable `favoriteNumber`.

## Understanding Function visibility

In Solidity, functions and variables can have one of four visibility specifiers: 
- `public`
- `private`
- `external` (only for functions)
- `internal`
  
If a visibility specifier is not given, it defaults to `internal`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Public functions** are visible both internally and externally. On the other hand, **private functions** can only be accessed by the *current contract*. Private does not hide a value; rather, it restricts access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **External functions** are only visible externally and are not accessible within the contract. **Internal functions** are accessible only by the current contract and any contract that is inherited from it.

## Pure and View keywords

The terms `view` and `pure` are used when the function will read values from the blockchain without altering its state. Such functions will not initiate transactions but rather make calls, represented as blue buttons in the Remix interface. A `pure` function will prohibit any reading from the state or storage.

```solidity
function retrieve() public view returns(uint256){
    return favoriteNumber;
}
```
<img src="/solidity/remix/lesson-2/functions/blue-button.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

The `return` keyword will specify the value type(s) a function returns.

```solidity
function retrieve() public pure returns(uint256){
    return 7;
}
```

> [!WARNING]
While calling `view` or `pure` functions doesn‚Äôt tipically require gas, they do require it when called by another function that modifies the state or storage through a transaction (e.g. calling the function `retrieve` inside the function `storage`). This cost is called **execution cost** and it will add up to the transaction cost.

## The scope of a variable

The scope of a variable is defined by the curly braces enclosing its declaration. A variable is accessible only within its defined scope. To access the same variable across different functions, it should be declared inside the scope of the main contract.

```solidity
function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
    favoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber;
    uint256 testVar = 5;
}

function something() public {
   testVar = 6; // will raise a compilation error
   favoriteNumber = 7; // this can be accessed because it's in the main contract scope
}
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you have learned how to build a function in Solidity, define its visibility, and understand how it operates on values within a smart contract. You have also explored different transactions their gas consumption. Let's continue learning!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Test yourself
1. üìï Describe four function visibility keywords and their impact on the code.
2. üìï Distinguish between `view` and `pure`.
3. üìï In which circumnstances a pure function will incur gas costs?
4. üìï Explain variable scope and provide an example of an incorrect scope.
5. üßë‚Äçüíª Write a contract that features 3 functions:
    - a view function that can be accessed only by the current contract
    - a pure function that's not accessible within the current contract
    - a view function that can be accessed from children's contracts
