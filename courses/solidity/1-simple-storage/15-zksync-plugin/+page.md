### Introduction

In this lesson, you're about to learn the same type of layer 2 or rollup deployment that professionals are using. On Remix, we can start by activating the **zkSync plugin** in our development environment. In the plugin manager, search for zkSync and activate the zkSync module. You'll notice a new zkSync tab on the left side.

This module comprises sections designed to compile, deploy, and interact with Remix contracts on zkSync.

### Compiling

Let's start by compiling the `SimpleStorage.sol` file by hitting the "Compile" button.

> üëÄ‚ùó**IMPORTANT** <br>
> Ensure that the **Solidity Compiler Version** in the contract matches the _[zkSync compiler requirements](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu?tab=readme-ov-file#zksync-l2-deploy)_. As of this recording, the required version is `0.8.24`.

### Deploying

After compilation, proceed to the `environment tab` to connect your MetaMask wallet, ensuring it is set to the _zkSync Sepolia testnet_. Once connected, you can **deploy and verify** the `SimpleStorage` contract.

### Verifying Deployment

After hitting deploy, MetaMask will request a **signature**. Approve it, and after a short delay, a detailed output will appear indicating the deployment status. If the terminal output shows a green "verification successful" message, it means that your contract has been both deployed and verified correctly.

### Checking the Deployment

To check our deployment, copy the contract address and paste it into the [zkSync Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/). Here, you can view the contract details.
