Congratulations on completing the Solidity Fundamentals course! You now understand the basics of deploying and working with smart contracts, which are essential skills for a smart contract developer or a security researcher.

Next, we'll move on to the **Foundry** course. Foundry is a smart contract framework that will enhance our smar contract development skills, allowing us to create safer tests, deploy contracts programmatically, and more.

Take a well deserved break: get some ice cream, go for a walk, or hit the gym. Looking forward to seeing you in the Foundry course üê∏!
