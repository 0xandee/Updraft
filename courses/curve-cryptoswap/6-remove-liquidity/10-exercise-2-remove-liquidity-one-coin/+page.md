### Remove Liquidity One Coin

For this exercise, we will call the function `remove_liquidity_one_coin`. The contract has already added 1,000 USDC as liquidity. Our goal is to return all of the LP shares owned by the contract back to the pool contract. Then we will withdraw the liquidity in a single token which is USDC.
