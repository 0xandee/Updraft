The following is an ai-generated transcript from a section of a smart contract course. Some of the words or spellings might be wrong, try to correct them based on context clues.

Can you update the transcript to be a markdown file set of instructions for a text based course on the same information?

Can you please place your ENTIRE output between 4 backticks (````) so that I can copy paste all the markdown, like so:

````
# Stuff here
```
code inside code
```
