Let me begin the story with a sneak peek into the current state of Web Three security.

The graph above is a collection of data from a group called `Chainalysis`. Represented in the graph is the total value stolen in crypto hacks and the number of hacks over the last six years. As of 2023, the total loss to hacks is close to $3.1 billion. Let that sink in.

But why does this matter?

With the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) currently at $40 billion, the loss to hacks stands at a whopping 7% of all DeFi TVL. In simple terms, for every 20 steps you take into the DeFi bank, there's a chance you could lose a step.

Peter, who runs a newsletter called *Blockchain Threat Intelligence*, did an overview of the main risks and financial losses as of early June 2023. Below is the updated list, as strange as it may seem, common attack vectors like stolen private keys and price Oracle manipulation attacks are consistent high performers.


1. Price Oracle manipulation.
2. Reward manipulation.
3. Stolen private keys.
4. Insufficient Function Access Control.
5. Logic Errors.
6. Function Parameter Validation.
7. Misconfiguration.
8. Governance Attacks.
9. Read-Only Reentrancy.
10. Reentrancy.

In this vast ocean of security threats, it's critical to ask; What's going well, what's not, and how do we move forward? For the future of Web3, these numbers must reduce.

## What's Going Well?

First off, the fact that you're reading this course is a positive step. The Web3 space has seen significant improvements in education, tooling, and the prioritization of security by protocols. The Comparative Security Paradigm which answers the "Pay now for security or Pay terrible hack prices later?" has more often than not seen protocols choose security. Enhancing security has been observed to result in a 99% reduction in potential "wreck" costs.

In recent times, the job market for Pre-deployment security has grown, with companies such as **Cyfrin**, **Trail of bits**, **Openzeppelin**, and [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) leading the pack. The audit sector has seen competitive platforms like [Solidit](https://solodit.xyz/) provide opportunities for growth and learning.

The community has also seen a significant influx of independent security researchers and leaderboard jumpers. In essence, the field offers several opportunities for budding enthusiasts to make their mark.

## What's Not Going Well?

Despite improvements, the Web 3.0 space still grapples with legacy problems. The continued use of centralized technologies within the sector, poor post-appointment practices, and the disregard for established security practices have resulted in sustained losses.

Furthermore, a disconnect between the community and security professionals has posed a significant barrier to general security. Often, the lack of user awareness and failure to digest security reports have resulted in needless losses through known vulnerabilities.

Consequently, the industry needs a form of rejuvenation. One where security is not just a concept – but a lifestyle.

## The Promise of Web3 Security

The promise of Web3 is far-reaching. It has the potential to revolutionize life and fundamentally reshape the financial ecosystem. However, Bank-level security is a prerequisite for this promise. The battle for a secure Web3 is not just one for security researchers and developers – it's for everyone.

### Exercise Section

At this juncture, Pause and take a moment to ask yourself, 'why do I want to contribute to the future of Web3 security?' Write it down somewhere. Whether it's for the potential earnings, societal impact, or personal achievement, write it down.

Here's how to do it, for any terminal lovers:

```bash
mkdir security_course
cd security_course
code .
```

Once you're in your text editor, write out your reasoning and future goals. Remember, it’s not a contest, be honest with yourself.

```markdown
# - My Web3 Security Goals- Secure the future of finance. 
# - Acquire the knowledge to protect personal investments.
# - Contribute to a safer, decentralized world.
```

Revisit your goals when the learning curve feels steep, or when the path seems uncertain – the end goal justifies the late-night oil. Together, we are on a mission to make the world of Web3 safer.

In the next section, we'll touch on Solidity and Foundry, providing a refresher on essential tools for Web3 Security.

Congratulations! You've taken the first step in your journey to becoming a security researcher. Now, let's dive deep into the world of solidity!
