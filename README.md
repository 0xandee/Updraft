# Cyfrin Updraft

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Cyfrin Updraft. This repository houses the written content of our courses, organized to facilitate easy access and contribution from our community.

## Repository Structure

Our content is structured as follows:

- `courses/`
  - `course_name/`
    - `lesson_name/`
      - `lesson_content.md`

Each course is contained within its own directory, and within each course, you will find directories for each lesson, which contain a Markdown file (.md) with the lesson's content.

## How to Contribute

We deeply value community contributions, whether it's correcting typos, enhancing code snippets, or refining our educational content. Here's how you can contribute:
